As per sub-section (2), where the right, title and interest and liabilities of Burmah Shell in relation to its undertakings in India vest in a government company under sub-section (1), such government company shall on and from the date of vesting be deemed to have become the owner, tenant or lessee, as the case may be, in relation to such undertakings; and all the rights and liabilities of the central government in relation to such undertakings shall on and from the date of such vesting be deemed to have become the rights and liabilities of the government company.",
        "28. Sub-section (3) made it clear that provisions of sub-section (2) of section 5 shall apply to a lease or a tenancy which vests in a government company as they apply to a lease or tenancy vested in the central government. Reference to the central government therein shall be construed as reference to the government company.",
        "29. It may be mentioned that Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (for short BPCL hereinafter) is a government company to whom central government had transferred the assets of Burmah Shell under the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act,",
        "30. Thus BPCL became the lessee of the premises.",

        "33. 2002 stating that the lease deed would expire on",

Union of India, AIR 1985 Bombay",
        "48. Therefore, the court ordered that the only reliefs which survived for adjudication were prayer clauses (b) and (c) i.e., challenge to the letter dated",

        "59. 2011 admitted the civil revision application and passed an order that it would be appropriate if the civil revision application was heard along with the writ petition. That is how both the writ petition and the civil revision application came to be tagged together.",
        "60. By the Repealing and Amending Act No.23 of 2016, the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1976 was repealed by the Parliament alongwith other acts.",

        "67. Though detailed submissions were made by learned counsel for the parties, it may not be necessary to elaborately deal with the same as the subject matter of the lis has now come down to a narrow compass. Nonetheless we may mention that Dr. Sathe, learned senior counsel for the petitioner strenuously argued that renewal of the lease deed by BPCL vide letter dated",
        "68. 2004 was not in accordance with law as no reasons were furnished and there was no elaboration as to why BPCL sought renewal of lease deed; Mr. Damle, learned senior counsel for BPCL on the other hand submits that in so far the writ petition is concerned, there is no live issue left for adjudication after dismissal of the appeal of the petitioner by the Appellate Bench of the Small Causes Court. He submits that in so far the civil revision application is concerned, there is concurrent finding by two courts below and there is no good reason as to why such finding should be disturbed.",
        "69. Responding to this, Dr. Sathe submits that the lower appellate court while dismissing the appeal of the petitioner committed grave error of fact as well as of law which is required to be corrected in the revision application. Discussion",
        "70. Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties have received the due consideration of the court.",
        "71. The Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1976 (briefly the Burmah Shell Act) was enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the right, title and interest of Burmah Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company of India Limited (already referred to as Burmah Shell) in relation to its undertakings in India with a view to ensuring co-ordinated distribution and utilization of petroleum products distributed and marketed in India by the said company and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The preamble says that Burmah Shell, a foreign company, was carrying on in India the business of distributing and marketing petroleum products and for that purpose had established places of business at Bombay and other places in India. It was further mentioned that it was expedient in the public interest that the undertakings in India of Burmah Shell should be acquired in order to ensure that the ownership and control of the petroleum products distributed and marketed in India by Burmah Shell were vested in the State and thereby so distributed as best to subserve the common good.",
        "72. Section 2(a) defined the appointed day to mean the date of commencement of the Burmah Shell Act. As per section 3, on the appointed day, the right, title and interest of Burmah Shell in relation to its undertakings in India shall stand transferred to and shall vest in the central government.",
        "73. Section 5 is relevant for the present discourse. The heading is, central government to be lessee or tenant under certain circumstances. As per sub-section (1), in respect of any property held by Burmah Shell in India under any lease or under any right of tenancy, the central government shall be deemed to have become the lessee or tenant, as the case may be, in respect of such property on and from the appointed day. Sub-section (2) says that on expiry of the term of any lease or tenancy referred to in sub-section (1), such lease or tenancy shall be renewed if so desired by the central government. Section 5 is quoted hereunder:-",
        "74. Central Government to be lessee or tenant under certain circumstances.- (1) Where any property is held in India by Burmah Shell under any lease or under any right of tenancy, the Central Government shall, on and from the appointed day, be deemed to have become the lessee or tenant, as the case may be, in respect of such property as if the lease or tenancy in relation to such property had been granted to the Central Government, and thereupon all the rights under such lease or tenancy shall be deemed to have been transferred to, and vested in, the Central Government. (2) On the expiry of the term of any lease or tenancy referred to in sub-section (1), such lease or tenancy shall, if so desired by the Central Government, be renewed on the same terms and conditions on which the lease or tenancy was held by Burmah Shell immediately before the appointed day.",
        "75. From the above, we find that in terms of sub-section (2), on expiry of the term of any lease or any tenancy which came to be vested in the central government by virtue of sub-section (1), the same shall be renewed on the same terms and conditions on which the lease or tenancy was held by Burmah Shell immediately before the appointed day, if so desired by the central government.",
        "76. Section 7 deals with power of central government to direct vesting of the undertakings of Burmah Shell in a government company. The said provision also has relevance in the present proceeding and is, therefore, extracted hereunder:-",
        "77. Power of Central Government to direct vesting of the undertakings of the Burmah Shell in a Government company.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in sections 3, 4 and 5, the Central Government may, if it is satisfied that a Government company is willing to comply, or has complied, with such terms and conditions as that Government may think fit to impose, direct by notification, that the right, title and interest and the liabilities of Burmah Shell in relation to any of its undertakings in India shall, instead of continuing to vest in the Central Government, vest in the Government company either on the date of the notification or on such earlier or later date (not being a date earlier than the appointed day) as may be specified in the notification. (2) Where the right, title and interest and the liabilities of Burmah Shell in relation to its undertakings in India vest in a Government company under sub- section (1), the Government company shall, on and from the date of such vesting, be deemed to have become the owner, tenant or lessee, as the case may be, in relation to such undertakings, and all the rights and liabilities of the Central Government in relation to such undertakings shall, on and from the date of such vesting, be deemed to have become the rights and liabilities, respectively, of the Government company. (3) The provisions of sub- section (2) of section 5 shall apply to a lease or tenancy, which vests in a Government company, as they apply to a lease or tenancy vested in the Central Government, and reference therein to the Central Government shall be construed as a reference to the Government company.",
        "78. Sub-section (1) of section 7 says that the central government may if it is satisfied that a government company is willing to comply or has complied with such terms and conditions as the government may think fit to impose, direct by notification that the right, title and interest and the liabilities of Burmah Shell in relation to any of its undertakings in India shall instead of continuing to vest in the central government, vest in the government company. Sub-section (2) clarifies that upon such vesting, the right, title and interest and liabilities of Burmah Shell shall be deemed to have become the right, title and interest and liabilities of the government company. In terms of sub-section (3), provisions of subsection (2) of section 5 shall apply to a lease or tenancy which vests in a government company as they apply to a lease or tenancy vested in the central government and any reference to the central government shall be construed to be a reference to the government company.",
        "79. As already noted in the earlier part of this judgment, BPCL is a government company to whom the central government had transferred the assets of Burmah Shell in exercise of powers under section 7 of the Burmah Shell Act. By virtue of sub-section (3) of section 7, BPCL stepped into the shoes of the central government in so far the lease deed dated",
        "80. 1969 is concerned and became the lessee.",
        "81. Constitutionality of section 5(2) and section 7(3) of the ESSO (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1974 was questioned before a Division Bench of this court in Trade Centre Developers and Builders Private Limited (supra). It may be mentioned that those two provisions were para materia to the provisions of section 5(2) and section 7(3) of the Burmah Shell Act. In fact both the enactments in object and substance were identical. By the said judgment this court held that the said provisions could not be termed as unconstitutional and accordingly upheld constitutionality of the said provisions.",
        "82. This court in the order dated",
        "83. 2008 referred to the above decision in Trade Centre Developers and Builders Private Limited (supra) and took the view that out of the three reliefs claimed by the petitioner, the first one i.e., declaration of sections 5 and 7 of Burmah Shell Act as ultra vires and unconstitutional stood covered by the said judgment. Therefore, it was ordered that only the other two questions remained for consideration.",
        "84. At this stage, we may mention that by the Repealing and Amending Act, 2016, the whole of the Burmah Shell Act was repealed along with several other enactments. However, section 4 of the Repealing Act clarified that despite repealing of the Burmah Shell Act, the same would not affect the validity, invalidity, effect or consequences of anything already done or suffered or any right, title, obligation or liability already acquired, accrued or incurred under the Burmah Shell Act; nor would it affect any pending proceeding in relation to the Burmah Shell Act.",
        "85. That being the position, we are not inclined to entertain the challenge to constitutional validity of section 5(2) and section 7(3) of the Burmah Shell Act. Prayer No.1 is accordingly rejected.",
        "86. This brings us to prayer Nos.2 and 3 i.e., quashing of letter dated",
        "87. 2004 and for a direction to BPCL to handover vacant and peaceful possession of the premises.",
        "88. From the pleaded facts we find that a lease deed was executed between the petitioner Modern India Limited and Burmah Shell in respect of the premises on",
        "89. By the lease deed, the premises were granted on lease to Burmah Shell for a period of 35 years commencing from",
        "90. 1969 to",
        "91. Lease rent was fixed at Rs.66,",
        "92. 00 per annum from",
        "93. 1969 to",
        "94. 1984; Rs.72,",
        "95. 00 per annum from",
        "96. 1984 to",
        "97. 1994; and Rs.80,",
        "98. 00 per annum from",
        "99. 1994 to",
        "100. By virtue of the Burmah Shell Act, Burmah Shell came to be replaced by BPCL as the lessee.",
        "101. As the term of the lease deed was on the verge of expiry petitioner wrote to BPCL on",
        "102. 2002 stating that the lease deed would expire on",
        "103. BPCL was requested to inform the petitioner as to whether it would like to renew the lease for further tenure and if so on what terms and conditions. BPCL vide letter dated",
        "104. 2004 informed the petitioner that in terms of sections 5 and 7 of the Burmah Shell Act it had a statutory right to renew the lease for a further period of 35 years with effect from",
        "105. 2004 on the same terms and conditions as contained in the registered lease deed which BPCL was exercising for getting the renewal for a further period of 35 years with effect from",
        "106. Petitioner had objected to the said exercise of extension of lease by BPCL and in this connection had issued a pleaders notice dated",
        "107. 2004 to BPCL. BPCL was thereby called upon to vacate the premises and to handover peaceful possession thereof to the petitioner. Ultimately, petitioner filed a suit in the Small Causes Court at Mumbai which was registered as T.E.&R. Suit No.125/142 of",
        "108. The suit was for recovery of possession of the premises and for mesne profits from the date of filing of the suit till recovery of actual physical possession. However by the judgment and order dated",
        "109. 2007, the suit was dismissed. While dismissing the suit, the trial court held that defendant No.1 (BPCL) had admittedly issued a letter dated",
        "110. 2004 exercising the right to renew the lease on the same terms for a further period of 35 years with effect from",
        "111. When the petitioner preferred appeal being Appeal No.165 of 2007, the Appellate Bench in the Court of Small Causes at Mumbai dismissed the appeal vide judgment and order dated",
        "112. Referring to sections 5 and 7 of the Burmah Shell Act, the lower appellate court held that transfer of property had taken place by operation of law. Therefore, such transfer of property need not meet the requirements of the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 or of the Indian Registration Act,",
        "113. Referring to the letter dated",
        "114. 2004 of BPCL it was held that the said letter disclosed the intention of BPCL to renew the lease for a further period of 35 years as per section 5(2) of the Burmah Shell Act. The same cannot be refused either by the petitioner or by the court. It is a statutory right given to BPCL by section 5(2) of the Burmah Shell Act. In this connection, the lower appellate court further held as follows:-",
        "115. … When the defendants claim the renewal of the lease then, they have got statutory right under special law i.e., Burmah Shell Act, then Transfer of Property Act will not come into operation. As per the case law mentioned above, Transfer of Property Act is applicable to the transaction or transfer by acts of parties and not by operation of law. In the present case, when the plaintiffs once entered into transaction of transfer with the defendants, then it will be governed by the Burmah Shell Act and it will prevail over the Transfer of Property Act. In the present case, the defendants have got the right to renew the said agreement of tenancy for further 35 years. In the present case, the plaintiffs cannot claim possession of the suit premises unless and until expiration of further period which is liable to be renewed by operation of the law for further 35 years. Thus, the plaintiffs have got right to claim possession only after second term i.e., further extended period of 35 years only, and not prior to that. After second term of extension there is no any provision for further extension in the time by statute itself, then, plaintiffs have got right straightway to issue notice claiming possession of the suit premises. Till this date plaintiffs are not permitted to claim the possession and suit of the plaintiffs is liable to be dismissed.",
        "116. Thus from the above, we find that the lower appellate court held that plaintiffs (petitioner) cannot claim possession of the suit premises until and unless the expiration of the further period liable to be renewed by operation of law which is 35 years. Though not necessary and somewhat unwarranted the lower appellate court went on to hold that the plaintiffs (petitioner) have got the right to claim possession only after the second term i.e., after the extended period of 35 years and not prior to that; after such extension, there is no provision for further extension in terms of the statute. Therefore, plaintiffs (petitioner) have got right to straightaway issue notice claiming possession of the suit premises at that stage; but prior thereto plaintiffs (petitioner) cannot claim possession.",
        "117. Upholding the decision of the trial court, the lower appellate court dismissed the appeal of the petitioner by holding that plaintiffs (petitioner) are not entitled to get possession of the suit premises from the defendants (BPCL).",
        "118. The above is a concurrent finding rendered by two courts of law. In the face of such finding returned by the civil courts, it is not possible to accede to prayer Nos.2 and 3 raised by the petitioner in the writ petition i.e., quashing of letter dated",
        "119. 2004 and for a direction to BPCL to handover vacant and peaceful possession of the premises to the petitioner.",
        "120. However, at this stage we may mention that Dr. Sathe, learned senior counsel for the petitioner laid great emphasis on the expression if so desired by the central government as appearing in sub-section (2) of section",
        "121. To appreciate his submission, we may once again extract subsection (2) of section",
        "122. As noticed, under sub-section (1) of section 5 where any property is held in India by Burmah Shell under any lease or under any right of tenancy, central government shall be deemed to have become the lessee or the tenant as the case may be in respect of such property on and from the appointed day. Under sub-section (2), such lease or tenancy shall be renewed on the same terms and conditions, if so desired by the central government. Sub-section (2) of section 5 is extracted once again and reads as under:-",
        "123. Central Government to be lessee or tenant under certain circumstances.- (1) ... (2) On the expiry of the term of any lease or tenancy referred to in sub-section (1), such lease or tenancy shall, if so desired by the Central Government, be renewed on the same terms and conditions on which the lease or tenancy was held by Burmah Shell immediately before the appointed day.",
        "124. It is his contention that BPCL is a state within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, it has to act fairly and reasonably. The desire of the central government as expressed in subsection (2) of section 5 cannot be based on subjective satisfaction; it must be based on objective criteria. Therefore, reasons must be given by BPCL which had stepped into the shoes of the central government and Burmah Shell as to why it desired to renew the lease agreement. In this connection, reliance has been placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in BPCL Vs. Maddula Ratnavalli, (2007) 6 SCC",
        "125. We have carefully examined the decision of the Supreme Court in Maddula Ratnavalli (supra). That was also a case where sub-section (2) of section 5 of the Burmah Shell Act, more particularly the expression if so desired by the central government came up for consideration. Supreme Court held that when the statute uses the words if so desired by the central government, such a desire cannot be based upon a subjective satisfaction. It must be based on objective criteria. It was in that context that Supreme Court held that an executive action must be informed by reason. The state acting whether as a landlord or as a tenant is required to act bonafide and not arbitrarily when the same is likely to affect prejudicially the rights of others.",
        "126. Having noticed the above, we may revert back to the letter dated",
        "127. 2004 issued by BPCL to the petitioner informing the petitioner about its decision for renewal of the lease for a further period of 35 years with effect from",
        "128. BPCL stated that in terms of sections 5 and 7 of the Burmah Shell Act it had a statutory right to renew the lease for a further period of 35 years with effect from",
        "129. 2004 on the same terms and conditions as contained in the lease deed and, therefore, it exercised the said right. Though the letter could have been a little more elaborate but that does not in our view in any manner impeach the decision of BPCL which was expressed in a clear and unambiguous manner. This letter was in response to the letter of the petitioner dated",
        "130. 2002 whereby it wanted to know from BPCL as to whether it would like to renew the lease after expiry and if so on what terms and conditions. The response of BPCL as contained in the letter dated",
        "131. 2004 has to be read in the context of petitioners letter dated",
        "132. Thus in the light of the above, we do not find any good ground to interfere with the decision of BPCL as contained in the letter dated",
        "133. That apart, in the light of the clear finding of the civil court, the third prayer cannot also be acceded to.",
        "134. We therefore proceed to the civil revision application but before that we may take note of the stand taken by BPCL in its reply affidavit to the writ petition.",
        "135. In paragraph 3 of the reply affidavit it is stated that even before filing of the writ petition BPCL had approached the petitioner for increase in rental but petitioner did not give a proper response. Though during the pendency of the writ petition there had been negotiations between the parties, however, no conclusion could be reached as the final terms could not be agreed upon. It is stated that respondent BPCL had always been fair and reasonable in its dealing with the petitioner and is even now willing to negotiate for increase in the rent.",
        "136. We appreciate the stand taken by BPCL. We may note that in respect of the lease deed dated",
        "137. 1969, lease rent was fixed at Rs.66,",
        "138. 00 per annum from",
        "139. 1969 to",
        "140. 1984; Rs.72,",
        "141. 00 per annum from",
        "142. 1984 to",
        "143. 1994; and Rs.80,",
        "144. 00 per annum from",
        "145. 1994 to",
        "146. Therefore, it is evident that there was not one uniform annual rent throughout the entire tenure of the lease period of 35 years. There was a slab for the first fifteen years which was enhanced for the next ten years and further enhanced for the last ten years. We are of the view that since BPCL had exercised its statutory right of renewal of the lease agreement on the same terms and conditions, the periodical rental enhancements in the previous lease period should also be made applicable to the renewed lease period keeping in mind various other economic factors. As held by the Supreme Court in Maddula Ratnavalli (supra), BPCL being a state, while acting as a tenant is required to act in a fair, reasonable and bona fide manner. We are also fortified in taking the above view by the order dated",
        "147. 2009 passed by this court in the writ petition. This court while admitting the writ petition had directed BPCL to pay to the petitioner the agreed rent due and payable from the year 2004 during pendency of the writ petition, clarifying that the same would be subject to the final decision of the writ petition. It was also clarified that right of the petitioner to claim increased lease rent is also one of the issues under consideration.",
        "148. In so far the civil revision application is concerned, we have already extracted the relevant portion of the judgment and order dated",
        "149. 2010 passed by the lower appellate court. In addition to what we had extracted above, we may further extract the following portion from the judgment and order dated",
        "150. 2010:-",
        "151. As per the ratio laid down in the above case law, the crux is that the transfer of property takes place by operation of law. The Transfer of Property Act is applicable to the transfer by act of the parties. A transfer by operation of law is not validated or invalidated by anything contained in the Act. The transfer takes place by operation of law, therefore, need not meet the requirements of the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act or Indian Registration Act.",
        "152. So far as the above case law is concerned, after issuing notice by the Plaintiffs the defendants received a letter disclosing the desire of defendants to renew the said agreement of lease for further 35 years with effect from",
        "153. 2004 by letter dated",
        "154. 2004 vide Exh.",
        "155. The said letter clearly shows the intention of the defendant to renew the contract of lease for further 35 years as per Section 5(2) of Burmah Shell Act. The lease deed is also filed on record. It also gives right to the defendants to renew the same. As per para 7 of the lease deed, the lease is renewable at the desire of the lessee. In this case, when there is a written demand of renewal, it gives statutory rights to the defendants to renew the lease deed for further 35 years as per section 5(2) of Burmah Shell Act. In this case, it is an admitted position that by written letter mentioned above, the defendant has put their desire to renew the said lease for further 35 years. It will clearly show that the defendants wanted to renew the same terms and conditions and it cannot be refused either by the plaintiffs or by this Court. It is a statutory right given to the defendants by section 5(2) of the said Act.",
        "156. When we hold that the defendants have right to get the lease deed renewed as of a statutory right, then the Transfer of Property Act and MRC Act has no application and the appellants/plaintiffs have no right to deny the same. The plaintiffs cannot avail the relief of eviction of the suit premises on the grounds mentioned by him in the plaint, because there is non-obstante clause in section 11 of the Burmah Shell Act. Section 11 speaks like this, The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act or in any decree or order of any Court, tribunal or other authority. As per section 11, any other law for time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of law other than the Burmah Shell Act or in any decree or order of any Court, Tribunal or other authority. This Act will make effect on the order. As per this non-obstante clause the other Acts like Transfer of Property Act, MRC Act become ineffective and plaintiffs will not get any right to evict the defendants.",
        "157. Not only there is a concurrent finding by the two lower courts below, we are also of the view that the findings reached are in accordance with law and do not in any manner contravene any legal provision. It is not a case of the courts below exercising jurisdiction not vested by law or had failed to exercise the jurisdiction so vested or having acted in the exercise of the jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity. We, therefore, do not find it to be a fit case for interference in exercise of our revisional jurisdiction. Interim Applications",
        "158. However, following our discussion made in paragraph 41 above, we may briefly refer to the various interim applications filed in the writ petition as well as in the civil revision application.",
        "159. Civil Application No.481 of 2017 was filed by Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited for intervention in the civil revision application. It stated that for construction of the underground Mahalaxmi Station it required about 518 sq.mtrs. of land which was part of the suit land covered by the civil revision application. It was stated that 518 square meters of the land was required for temporary possession for facilitating the work out of which an area of 316 sq.mtrs. was required for permanent underground rights for Mahalaxmi Station. This court vide order dated",
        "160. 2019 permitted the applicant / intervenor - Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited to deposit in court to the account of the civil revision applicant an appropriate sum to be decided by the compensation committee appointed by the applicant / intervenor every six months as advance six monthly payment towards compensation for temporary possession of 518 sq.mtrs. of the land till completion of underground Mahalaxmi Station with liberty to the applicant / intervenor for determining the amount of compensation for permanent underground rights in respect of 316 sq.mtrs. of land. The civil application was accordingly disposed of. Order dated",
        "161. 2019 is extracted hereunder:- . This civil application has been taken out by the Applicant, who intervenes in the matter. The Applicant is Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. Its case is that for construction of underground Mahalaxmi Station, it requires about 518 sq. mtrs. of suit land, which is the subject matter of the present civil revision application, for temporary possession for facilitating the work, out of which an area of 316 sq. mtrs. is required for permanent underground rights for Mahalaxmi Station. Total area of 518 sq. mtrs. required by it has been shown delineated in a map annexed to the civil application. So also is delineated on the map the area of 316 sq. mtrs. required for underground permanent construction. The area of 518 sq. mtrs. is said to be admittedly in occupation of the Respondent – Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, who were defendants in the revision applicants suit for eviction, which has since been dismissed by the trial court, and the decree of the trial court has since been affirmed by the appeal court. The present CRA has been filed from these decrees. It is submitted that 518 sq. mtrs. land has been already taken possession of by the Applicant/intervenor and, to that extent, prayer clause (a) of the civil application has been rendered practically infructuous. Learned Counsel for the Respondent/original applicant accepts that possession has been taken over by the Applicant / Intervenor. The question now is only of deposit of compensation, for which the Applicant/Intervenor has made a specific prayer in prayer clause (b) of its civil application. Since possession has already been taken over by the Applicant/ Intervenor, there is no difficulty in allowing this prayer. Accordingly, the Applicant/Intervener is permitted to deposit in Court to the account of the CRA herein an appropriate sum as may be decided by the compensation committee appointed by the Applicant/Intervenor every six months as advance six monthly payment towards compensation for temporary possession of 518 sq.mtrs. land till completion of underground Mahalaxmi Station and allied construction with liberty to the Applicant/Intervenor for determining the amount of compensation for permanent underground rights in respect of 316 sq.ft. suit land at such rate as may be decided by the compensation committee appointed by the Applicant/Intervenor for determining compensation for permanent underground rights. The civil application is disposed of accordingly.",
        "162. While on the civil revision application we find that petitioner has filed Interim Application (L) No.99618 of 2020 in the civil revision application. Prayer made in the said interim application is for a direction - (i) to BPCL to provide the details of compensation received from Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited; (ii) to grant leave to the petitioner to withdraw the amounts deposited by BPCL in court; and (iii) to direct Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited to pay compensation in respect of the land to the petitioner.",
        "163. No effective order has been passed in this interim application. Rather, vide order dated",
        "164. 2021 this court directed that the interim application would be heard along with the writ petition and the civil revision application.",
        "165. Petitioner has filed another interim application being Interim Application (L) No.99620 of 2020 in the civil revision application. Prayer made in this interim application is for a declaration that BPCL had committed a breach of the terms of the lease deed dated",
        "166. 1969 and, therefore, the said lease deed as renewed stood terminated. Consequential prayer made is that BPCL be directed to be evicted from the premises.",
        "167. Here also no effective order was passed by this court save and except the order dated",
        "168. 2021 directing hearing of the interim application along with the related writ petition and civil revision application.",
        "169. That brings us to the last interim application which is Interim Application (L) No.9613 of 2020 filed by the petitioner in the writ petition. The said interim application came to be filed when petitioner came to know from an expression of interest floated by the central government on",
        "170. 2020 that central government was planning to sell / transfer / alienate its ownership / shareholding / stake in the BPCL. It was in that context that prayer was made to maintain status-quo in respect of the premises till disposal of the writ petition."
