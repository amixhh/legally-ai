She stated that she received love and affection from her father, who was taking care of her food, education, and would assist her in her school projects and activities. Reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in Nil Ratan Kundu & Anr. v. Abhijit Kundu (2008) 9 SCC 413 : 2008 (11) SCALE 437 that while exercising parens patriae jurisdiction, the Court is required to give due weight to the ordinary comfort of the child, contentment, intellectual, moral and physical development, health, education and general maintenance, and the favorable surroundings. The Court is not bound either by statutes, nor by strict rules of evidence, nor procedure or precedent. In deciding the issue of custody, the paramount consideration should be the welfare and well-being of the child."
