The main issue for consideration in this appeal is whether the Board was justified in rejecting the application filed by the appellant under Section 17 of the Act of 2006 read with Regulation 18 of the Regulations of 2008, after the provisions contained in Section 16 of the Act of 2006 came into force on",

        "67. It is also not disputed that pursuant thereto, the appellant has laid approximately 75 kms of pipeline in both the cities of Udaipur and Jaipur, and in the process, spent a huge amount of money relying on the NOC granted in its favour for such purpose. The appellant asserts that is has completed the following activities in the two projects of Udaipur and Jaipur: \"Udaipur:a) Received permission to cut roads vide letter dated",
        "68. 2007, made payment of Rs.14,28,900 towards road cutting bill and provided Bank Guarantee to the Municipal Council of Udaipur in this respect;b) Purchase of material and services for the project, amounting to Rs.",

This agency was subsequently also authorised by the Board vide communication dated",

        "74. 22 lacs:d) The Petitioner has successfully laid 22610 mtrs. of gas distribution pipeline in Jaipur.?",
        "75. Section 17 of the Act of 2006, which Act was notified on",
        "76. 2006 (except Section 16) and came into force on",

        "78. However, the entity authorised by the Central Government for such activities would be required to furnish the particulars of such activities to the Board within 6 months from the appointed date. Sub Section 4 of Section 17 empowers the Board either to reject or accept such application, which power has to be exercised consistent with the norms and policy guidelines. Sub Section 5 provides that in case of refusal or conditional acceptance of an application, the Board shall record reasons in writing for such rejection or conditional acceptance.",
        "79. Section 16 of the Act of 2006, which came into force on",

The Proviso (ii) of the said section 16 provides for ‘deemed authorisation? in case an entity had been laying, building, operating or expanding any City or Local Gas Distribution Network, immediately before the appointed date, which shall be deemed to have such authorisation. In the present case, the appointed date is",
        "81. 2007 when the Act of 2006 was brought into force, except the provision contained in the Section 16 of the Act of 2006, which came into force on",
        "82. The Regulations of 2008 were framed before Section 16 of the Act of 2006 came into force. Regulation 18 of the Regulations of 2008 provides that an entity, not authorised by the Central Government for laying, building, operating or expanding CGD network before the appointed date, shall apply for obtaining an authorisation in the form as in Schedule I and the Board may take into consideration the criteria for considering the application for grant of authorisation in terms specified in clauses (a) to (j) of Regulation 18(2).",

Clause (b) provides that the entity, if not registered under Companies Act, 1956, shall undertake to become a company registered under the Companies Act,",
        "84. The other factors in clauses (c) and (d) as enumerated, relate to actual physical progress made and the financial commitment thereon, and requires a physical progress of at least 25 percent of capital expenditure before the appointed date, which may be considered as adequate. Clauses (e) and (f) provide that the entity should have arranged and procured the necessary equipment for erecting the City Gas Distribution network before the appointed date. Clause (g) provides for the entity to satisfy the Board on the adequacy of its ability to meet the applicable technical standards, specifications and safety standards as specified in the relevant Regulations. Clause (h) provides for assessment of financial position of the entity and Clause (i) provides for supply of natural gas to meet the demand in the authorised area to be covered by City Gas Distribution network. The last clause (j) provides for the Board to consider any other relevant criteria based on the examination of the application. All the aforesaid clauses are relevant factors and the one which is put for consideration in the present case is Clause (d), on which ground, the Central Government has primarily rejected the application of the appellant.",
        "85. It is noteworthy that the language used in Regulation 18(2) is that ?the Board may take into consideration…………?. As such, the language in which the Regulation has been couched does not make the consideration in the said clauses, including Clause (d), to be mandatory, but no doubt the same would be relevant considerations. On a careful perusal of the order passed by the Board, we find that the application of the appellant has been rejected for reasons mentioned in para 5 of the impugned order dated",
        "86. 2011, which are extracted hereunder: ?",
        "87. The committee found that you do not satisfy the conditions laid down under the Regulation 18(1) of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (Authorizing Entities to Lay, Build, Operate or Expand City or Local Natural Gas Distribution Networks) Regulations 2008 on account of the following:a) Physical and financial progress achieved by M/s. Adani Gas Limited before the appointed day in the GA of Jaipur does not satisfy the proviso 18(2)(d) of the Regulation 18(1) of Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (Authorizing Entities to Lay, Build, Operate or Expand City or Local Natural Gas Distribution Networks) Regulations 2008;b) Even After clear instructions of PNGRB vide Press Note Dated 30 th October, 2007 to stop all incremental activity M/s. Adani energy Limited had continued with laying of MDPE Pipeline and thus violating the directions of the Board.?",
        "88. From the above, it is clear that the application of the appellant has been rejected primarily on the ground of non¬compliance of clause (d) of Regulation 18(2) of the Regulations of",
        "89. It was incumbent on the Board to take into consideration various factors as specified in clauses (a) to (j) of Regulation 18(2) of the Regulations of 2008, and the same has to be considered in the back drop of the fact that the press note was issued on",
        "90. 2007 to stop all incremental activities and as such it was necessary to consider whether the appellant could have been faulted for non-compliance of clause (d) of Regulation 18(2), and whether it was a mandatory requirement or merely one of the factors to be considered along with all the other factors. Other relevant aspects as contained in the other clauses have not been adverted to by the Board while deciding the application of the appellant, which were also equally significant. It was necessary to consider whether the appellant is compliant of various other factors as provided in clauses (a) to (j) of Regulation 18(2) of the Regulations of",
        "91. The non¬ compliance, if any, of clause (d) ought to have been considered in the light of the press note dated",
        "92. 2007 which required stopping of all incremental activities.",
        "93. The peculiar factual position is that the Act of 2006 had been notified on",
        "94. 2006 but came into force on",
        "95. 2007 and the NOC was issued on",
        "96. 2006, after the Government of Rajasthan had invited open bids on",
        "97. 2005 for laying of City Gas Distribution network in the cities of Udaipur and Jaipur, in which the appellant had been selected. Besides depositing the sum of Rs. 2 Crores immediately towards commitment fee, the appellant had thereafter incurred mammoth expenditure after it was successful in the bids, which aspect has not been considered by the Board while deciding the application of the appellant. In our considered view, the same should not have normally been over looked. Besides the same, in the factual circumstances of the present case, the provision of ‘deemed authorisation? contained in Proviso (ii) to Section 16 had also been enforced on",
        "98. 2010 and it was necessary for the Board to have considered whether it was a case where only certain safeguards were required to be observed in view of the ‘deemed authorisation?.",
        "99. We are of the firm view that it was also necessary for the Board to have considered all these aspects and thereafter to have decided the application relating to authorisation/conditions to be imposed under the Act, if any, required. Besides this, detailed replies had been submitted by the appellant before the Board, which also ought to have been considered. Further, the requirement under the Act/Regulations is for grant of personal hearing to the appellant before deciding its application and if personal hearing was given, to have discussed the same in the order, which aspect has also been ignored by the Board.",
        "100. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the opinion that there was illegality committed by the Board in deciding the application of the appellant while passing the order dated",
        "101. 2011, and as such the same deserves to be quashed. We also hold that in the aforesaid factual background, the decision of the State Government to revoke the NOC vide order dated",
        "102. 2011 was also highly unfair and unjust in as much as the reply of the petitioner dated",
        "103. 2011 in response to the notice dated",
        "104. 2011 has not been dealt with by the Government of Rajasthan while passing the said impugned order dated",
        "105. As such, the same does not stand to reason, which also deserves to be quashed."
