        "23. It is clear from the materials placed on record, in view of the differences cropped up between the parties, respondent- husband has filed petition for divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) (iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, in the year 2012 which is decreed ex-parte and appeal against that order is pending before the High Court. The appellant-wife is presently residing at her parental house at Shahjanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The boy is studying in Global International School, Shahjanpur, Uttar Pradesh, while granting ex-parte decree it appears that the Trial Court directed that their son should be admitted in Col. Satsangi’s Kiran Memorial Public School, New Delhi. In view of such direction, it appears, the boy was admitted in the said School at New Delhi and was allowed to be taken by the appellant-wife in the summer vacation of",
        "24. It is true that in Order dated",
        "25. 2018, the respondent was permitted to take the son and get him joined at Boarding House in Col. Satsangi’s Kiran Memorial Public School, New Delhi, and the appellant-wife was permitted to take custody of the boy in the summer vacation and to ensure that he returns to the Boarding House after summer vacation. It is the case of the appellant that after summer vacation the boy was not inclined to go to the Boarding House/School and wanted to study only in his old school, namely, Global International School, Shahjanpur. It is also not in dispute that the child was earlier studying in the same school where he is admitted now for further studies. We are informed now that he has now completed 3 rd standard and is aged about 10 years. It is natural, a boy of that age who has studied earlier in the school at Shahjanpur, willing to continue in the same school as much as he is acclimatised with the environment of such school where he has started his studies from Ist standard onwards. This Court also interacted with the boy and the boy expressed his desire to continue his studies only in Shahjanpur school. When the boy is not inclined to study in Col. Satsangi’s Kiran Memorial Public School, New Delhi, and stay in the Boarding House, we are of the view that in the interest of the welfare of the child, he cannot be compelled to admit in Col. Satsangi’s Kiran Memorial Public School, New Delhi, attached with the Boarding House. In such view of the matter, it cannot be said that the appellant-wife has violated the direction issued by the High Court vide Orders dated",
        "26. 2018 and",
        "27. From the very perusal of the order impugned, it appears that the High Court has ascertained the views of the boy and has recorded that he is very much attached and has more affiliation towards his mother (appellant herein). In that view of the matter we are of the opinion that the child, namely, Krish @ Master Krishav Gautam cannot be compelled to join in Col. Satsangi’s Kiran Memorial Public School at New Delhi. We are further of the view that in the interest and welfare of of the child, Krish @ Master Krishav Gautam shall be allowed to continue his study at Global International School, Shahjanpur.",
        "28. Further, in the impugned order, the appellant-wife is directed to elect one forum from which she wants to get the maintenance. As the same is also not in conformity with the law, the said direction is liable to be set aside. Ordered accordingly.",
        "29. As the respondent-husband is a natural father of the child, namely, Krish @ Master Krishav Gautam, he is also entitled to visitation rights. We permit the respondent- husband to visit his child and he is entitled to take the child from the House of the appellant on any Sunday’s and public holiday’s whenever he visits Shahjanpur. The appellant-wife shall allow the child to leave along with the respondent-father at 09:00 a.m., and the respondent-husband to return the child at the house of the appellant-wife before 06:00 p.m. on the same day. For any further modification of visitation rights respondent-father is at liberty to move the High Court with appropriate application and the same shall be considered in accordance with law, keeping in view the welfare of the child."
