        "1. Indira Banerjee, J.",
        "2. Leave granted.",
        "3. These appeals are against a judgment and order dated",
        "4. 2020, passed by the Division Bench of Delhi High Court, dismissing the Appeal being FAO(OS) (COMM) No.136 of 2019, filed by the Appellant under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996, hereinafter referred to, in short, as the A & C Act read with Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act 2015, and affirming an order dated",
        "5. 2019 passed by the Commercial Division of the Delhi High Court in OMP(I) (COMM) No.523/2017 under Section 9 of the A & C Act, whereby the Court refused to recall its earlier order dated",
        "6. 2019, directing the Appellant to substitute an irrevocable Bank Guarantee, issued by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC), Mumbai Branch for Rs.30 Crores furnished pursuant to an order dated",
        "7. 2019 of the Court, with a Bank Guarantee of a Scheduled Indian Bank of the same amount. The Appellant has also impugned a judgment and order dated",
        "8. 2021 passed by the Division Bench dismissing Review Petition No.5/2021 filed by the Appellant for review of the said judgment and order dated",
        "9. 2020 dismissing the Appeal.",
        "10. The short question in these Appeals is, whether the High Court was right in refusing to accept a legally valid irrevocable Bank Guarantee of Rs.30 Crores, issued by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited, Mumbai, hereinafter referred to as ICBC which is a Scheduled Bank included in the Second Schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, and insisting that the Appellant should furnish a fresh Bank Guarantee of the same amount, with identical terms, issued by a Scheduled Indian Bank, notwithstanding the expenditure incurred by the Appellant in obtaining the Bank Guarantee from ICBC.",
        "11. These Appeals are restricted only to the question of legality of the direction of the High Court, requiring the Appellant to substitute a legally valid irrevocable Bank Guarantee, issued by ICBC, which is a Scheduled Bank, carrying on business in India, with a Bank Guarantee of equivalent amount issued by a Scheduled Indian Bank.",
        "12. The Appellant, an entity incorporated in China was awarded contracts in relation to various coal based power projects in India and the Respondent, a company incorporated in India was engaged as a subcontractor of the Appellant. Disputes and differences between the Respondent and the Appellant were referred to Arbitration. The details of the contract between the Appellant and the Respondent, or the disputes and differences that arose therefrom, are irrelevant to the issues involved in these Appeals. Suffice it to mention that the Arbitration culminated in an Award dated",
        "13. 2017 of approximately Rs.1,42,00,00,000 (One hundred and forty two crores) in favour of the Respondent.",
        "14. On",
        "15. 2017, the Appellant filed an application under Section 34 of the A & C Act being O.M.P. (COMM) No. 432 of 2017 challenging the Arbitral Award dated",
        "16. 2017 in the Commercial Division of the Delhi High Court, which is pending.",
        "17. On the other hand, the Respondent filed an application being OMP (I) (COMM) No. 523/2017 in the Commercial Division of the High Court under Section 9 of the A & C Act seeking, inter alia, directions on the Appellant to secure the amount of the Arbitral Award.",
        "18. On",
        "19. 2019, a Single Bench of the Commercial Court of the High Court passed an order in O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) No. 523/2017 directing the Appellant to furnish to the Registry of the High Court, a Bank Guarantee for a sum of Rs.30 Crores, from a Scheduled Bank located in India. The operative part of the order dated",
        "20. 2019 is set out hereinbelow:-",
        "21. â€¦.. It is ordered accordingly.",
        "22. The Judgment Debtor will file the affidavit within two (2) weeks; with a copy being furnished to the counsel for the Decree Holder.",
        "23. Insofar as the bank guarantee is concerned, it will be furnished within 6 weeks as indicated by the counsel.",
        "24. Further, the bank guarantee in the sum of Rs.30 crores will be that of a scheduled bank located in India.",
        "25. Renotify the matter on",
        "26. In the meanwhile, the Judgment Debtor will continue to make deposit with the Registry of this Court in terms of the order dated",
        "27. On",
        "28. 2019, the Appellant got ICBC to issue an unconditional, irrevocable Bank Guarantee for a sum of Rs.30 Crores payable on demand to the Registrar General of the Delhi High Court. An electronic copy of the Bank Guarantee was filed in the Registry on",
        "29. Mr. K.V. Vishwanathan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant submitted that the Appellant incurred expenditure of Rs.30,00,000/- (Thirty Lakhs) approximately towards bank charges for furnishing the Bank guarantee. Furthermore, an amount of Rs.36,40,00,000/- was frozen in the Bank Account of the Appellant with ICBC in China.",
        "30. However, by an order dated",
        "31. 2019, the Single Bench directed the Appellant to substitute the Bank Guarantee issued by ICBC, which had been filed in the Registry of the High Court, by a Bank Guarantee of equivalent amount from a Scheduled Indian Bank. The relevant paragraphs of the said order are extracted hereinbelow:-",
        "32. Furthermore, Mr. Sethi says that in compliance of the order dated",
        "33. 2019 which required the respondent to furnish a bank guarantee of a Scheduled Bank, the respondent has complied with the same and submitted a bank guarantee of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (in short ICBC).",
        "34. However, a careful perusal of the order would show that Mr. Sethi had offered to furnish a bank guarantee of a Scheduled Indian bank and that while dictating the operative part of the order, I had indicated that it would be a scheduled bank located in India, therefore, the confusion, if any caused is now removed. The respondent will substitute the bank guarantee filed with a guarantee of a Scheduled Indian bank of an equivalent value.",
        "35. Pending the substitution, the Registry will hold on to the bank guarantee already submitted and the respondent will ensure that the same is kept alive.",
        "36. As to whether the bank guarantee already filed is valid, the matter will be placed before Joint Registrar (Judicial) on",
        "37. 1 It is made clear that as and when the respondent is ready to replace the bank guarantee furnished by ICBC with a bank guarantee of a Scheduled Indian Bank, on a request being made in that behalf via an appropriate application, the Joint Registrar (Judicial) will release the bank guarantee furnished by ICBC provided the request is backed by an undertaking of the duly authorized representative of the respondent that it shall place the bank guarantee of the Scheduled Indian Bank on record within a defined time line not exceeding 10 days from the date of the request.",
        "38. Pursuant to the direction of the Court, the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court scrutinized the Bank Guarantee furnished by the Appellant, recorded the statement of Mr. Ayush Ganediwala, Vice President of ICBC, who had appeared before him, and passed an order dated",
        "39. 2019, recording that the said Bank Guarantee was valid with effect from",
        "40. 2019 till",
        "41. Thereafter, the Appellant filed an application being IA No.7096 of 2019 for recall of the order dated",
        "42. 2019 of the Commercial Division (Single Bench) of the High Court directing the Appellant to substitute the Bank Guarantee issued by ICBC with a Bank Guarantee of equivalent value of a Scheduled Indian Bank.",
        "43. By an order dated",
        "44. 2019, the learned Single Bench dismissed the said application, inter alia observing:-",
        "45. I may clarify, at the outset, that it is not this courts endeavour to doubt in any manner the credentials of ICBC. The record, however, shows that the applicant/respondent had in fact, on its own, offered to furnish a bank guarantee of a Scheduled Indian Bank. The confusion, if any, in the mind of the applicant/respondent, as rightly pointed out by Mr. Nigam, was removed on",
        "46. The applicant/respondent has moved this application after nearly four weeks of the clarification issued in that behalf. Thus, having passed an order based, essentially, on the offer made by the counsel for the applicant/respondent, I do not see any good reason to recall the direction.",
        "47. From the orders dated",
        "48. 2019 and",
        "49. 2019, it appears that the senior Counsel, representing the Respondent in the High Court had vehemently objected to the Bank Guarantee of ICBC, arguing emphatically, that the Appellant itself had, through Counsel, offered to furnish a Bank Guarantee of a Scheduled Indian Bank, but had retracted from its offer, taking advantage of an inadvertent typographical error in Paragraph 6 of the order dated",
        "50. 2019, which read Further the bank guarantee in the sum of Rs.30 crores will be that of a scheduled bank located in India.",
        "51. The direction in the operative part of the order dated",
        "52. 2019 was clear. It required the Appellants to furnish a Bank Guarantee of a Scheduled Bank located in India. The Appellant complied with the direction and furnished a Bank Guarantee of a sum of Rs.30,00,000,00/- (Thirty Crores) from the Mumbai Branch of ICBC.",
        "53. May be, there was a mistake in passing the order dated",
        "54. 2019, in the sense that the Court had intended to pass an order in terms of the offer of the Appellant, to furnish a Bank Guarantee of a Scheduled Indian Bank. In the order dated",
        "55. 2019, the learned Judge very fairly stated that while dictating the operative part of the order, the learned Judge had said that the Bank Guarantee would be of a Scheduled Bank located in India. That is what the order read. A party cannot be faulted for acting in terms of the order as issued, particularly when there was no patent or obvious error in the direction to furnish a Bank Guarantee of a Scheduled Bank, located in India.",
        "56. It is true, that the order dated",
        "57. 2019 records the oral offer made on behalf of the Appellant, through Counsel, to submit a bank guarantee of a Scheduled Indian Bank. However, the direction in the operative part of the order dated",
        "58. 2019 gives the impression, that the offer of the Appellant to furnish a Bank Guarantee may have persuaded the Court to secure the Arbitral Award by directing the Appellant to furnish a Bank Guarantee of a Scheduled Bank located in India.",
        "59. As recorded in the order dated",
        "60. 2019, there may have been some confusion by reason of the direction to furnish a Bank Guarantee of a Scheduled Bank located in India. The language and tenor of the order dated",
        "61. 2019, as also the fact that the Respondent did not make any attempt to have the direction to furnish a Bank Guarantee of a Scheduled Bank located in India rectified and/or altered, shows that use of the expression Scheduled Indian Bank may have been understood by all concerned parties to include an Indian branch of a Scheduled Bank.",
        "62. Contrary to the contention of the Respondent, as recorded in the order dated",
        "63. 2019 of the Court, there was no typographical error in the order dated",
        "64. One can say that there is a typographical error when there is an inadvertent mistake in a figure or the spelling of a word by reason of pressing a wrong key of the keyboard or the omission or duplication of a word or phrase or even a sentence/sentences. A typographical error is obvious. That was not the case here.",
        "65. The direction to furnish a Bank Guarantee of a Scheduled Indian Bank located in India, is perfectly legal. There was no reason for the Appellant to proceed on the basis that the direction had been issued by mistake. The Respondent also did not take any steps to get the direction rectified or altered. The direction was allowed to remain intact for almost two months. In the meanwhile, the Appellant furnished a Bank Guarantee of an Indian Branch of ICBC, a Scheduled Bank in India.",
        "66. In this case, perhaps the intention of the Court was not expressed in the order accurately. However, the order was otherwise correctly worded and legally valid. It is not uncommon for Courts to give directions, which might be at variance with an oral offer. The Appellant having acted in accordance with the order dated",
        "67. 2019 and changed his position to his detriment by incurring an expenditure of about Rs.30 lakhs to comply with the said order, it was not appropriate for the Court to change the order.",
        "68. From the order dated",
        "69. 2019, it is clear that even the Single Bench accepted that there was a confusion due to the language and tenor of the direction in Paragraph 6 of the said order. Thus the Court, in effect, accepted that there may not have been any deliberateness on the part of the Appellant in furnishing a Bank Guarantee issued by ICBC.",
        "70. Being aggrieved by the order dated",
        "71. 2019 refusing to recall the earlier order of the Court dated",
        "72. 2019, directing the Appellant to replace the Bank Guarantee of ICBC, with a Bank Guarantee of a Scheduled Indian Bank, the Appellant filed an appeal under Section 37 of the A & C Act, read with Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act,",
        "73. The appeal was dismissed by the order of the Division Bench dated",
        "74. 2020 impugned before this Court. The prayer of the Appellant, for review of the Order dated",
        "75. 2020 was rejected by an order dated",
        "76. 2021, which is also under challenge before this Court.",
        "77. There may not be any infirmity in the order dated",
        "78. 2021, rejecting the prayer of the Appellant for review, having regard to the limited scope of an application for review. A matter cannot be re-argued in the garb of an application for review. Nor does the Review Court exercise appellate powers. All applications for review are governed by the principles enshrined in Section 114 read with Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure,",
        "79. A court is empowered to review its own order only if the conditions precedent for a review, as laid down in Section 114 read with Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure exist. In this case the prerequisites for a review did not exist."
