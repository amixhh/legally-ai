        "1. B.K. Mukherjea, CJ.",
        "2. These three appeals are directed against a common judgment of a Division Bench of the Hyderabad High Court dated 21-1-1954, by which the learned Judges affirmed, on appeal, three orders made by the City Civil Court, Hyderabad in three analogous execution proceedings arising out of the execution of the same decree. Two of these three execution cases were commenced by respondents 1 to 12 in Appeals Nos. 101 and l03 of this Court, while the third case was started by respondent 1 in Appeal No. l",
        "3. The appellants in the three appeals were the objectors in all the three execution proceedings and their objections having been overruled by both the courts below, have come up on appeal to this Court on the strength of a certificate granted by the High Court under Art. 133 (1) of the Constitution.",
        "4. This litigation has had a long history behind it, and to appreciate the points that have been canvassed before us, it will be necessary to narrate briefly the material facts.",
        "5. The dispute between the parties relates to rights of succession to the matrooka or personal estate left by one Nawab Wali-ud-Dowlah, a wealthy noble man and a high dignitary in the State of Hyderabad. The Nawab, who was a member of the Vicar-ul-Umra Paigah family and had been a Minister in the Hyderabad Government for many years, died on 22-2-1935, while he was on a pilgrimage to Hedjaz. Besides extensive Jagir properties appertaining to the Paigah which fetched an income of nearly Rs. 1, 36, 000 per year, he left matrooka or personal estate of considerable value.It is not disputed that Ameer-un-nissa Begam, appellant 1 in the appeals before us, was one of the wedded wives of the Nawab and that she and the five children, whom she bore to her husband, are entitled to their legitimate shares in the properties left by the deceased. There is also no. dispute that the Nawab was legally married to another lady named Fatima-un-nissa Begum, some time in",
        "6. Fatima-un-nissa Begum left her husbands house a few months after her marriage but the marriage was never dissolved. The only claim put forward by her against her husbands estate which is material for our present purpose is one to recover a sum of Rs. One lakh as dower debt.The controversy between the parties really centred round the point as to whether two other ladies, to wit, Mahboob Begum and Quadiran Begum were legally married wives of the late Nawab, or whether they were mere kavasesor permanent concubines kept by him. If there was no. legal marriage between them and the Nawab, it is not disputed that neither they, nor their children, though admittedly begotten on them by the Nawab, would be entitled to any share in the matrooka or the personal estate left by the deceased. Mahboob and Quadiran are respectively respondents 1 and 5 in Appeals Nos. 101 and 103 before us. Respondents 2 to 4 in these appeals are the children of Mahboob, while respondents 6 to 12 are the sons and daughters of the Nawab born of Quadiran Begum.",
        "7. The dispute first arose before the Paigah Trust Committee (Atiat) whose duty it was to distribute the income of the Paigah estate amongst the heirs of the late Nawab. It appears that in April 1935, shortly after Ameer-un-nissa Begum, who had accompanied her husband to Mecca, returned to Hyderabad after the death of the latter, the Paigah Committee addressed letters to Ameer-un-nissa, Fatima-un-nissa and Mahboob Begum enquiring about the wives and children left by the Nawab. No. letter, it seems, was addressed to Quadiran. On a consideration of the replies given by the addressees and also the statements made on their behalf at the hearing before the Committee, the latter drew up a report which was submitted to the Executive Council of the Nizam.The Committee proceeded on the footing that the Nawabs marriage with Ameer-un-nissa Begum was beyond dispute but as Mahboob Begum did not produce her marriage certificate even after repeated demands by the Committee, she as well as Quadiran were treated as concubines. The Committee recommended that the annual income of the Paigah should be divided in the proportion of 60 to 40 amongst the legitimate and illegitimate relations of the Nawab. Sixty per cent of the income was to go to Ameerunnissa Begum and her issue and the remaining 40 per cent, was to be paid to Mahboob Begum and Quadiran, as it well as to their children.These recommendations were approved by the Nizam by a Firman dated 9-7-",
        "8. Previous to this, express intimations were given to the surviving relations of Wali-ud-Dowlah under orders of the Nizam that whatever disputes might exist among them regarding matrooka or personal estate of the Nawab should be decided by proper proceedings in a Court of law and pending such decision the estate might be kept under the supervision of the Paigah Committee.A dispute arose some time afterwards regarding the pension to be given to the wives of the Nawab. The Council recommended that Ameerunnissa should be given a pension of Rs. 300 per month and a sum of Rs. 100 should be allowed to Mahboob Begum. Ameerunnissa Begum made a representation that Mahboob Begum was not a legally married wife of the Nawab and consequently was not entitled to claim or receive any pension. By a Firman dated 30-ll-1937, the Nizam directed that the entire pension should go to Ameernnissa Begum and Mahboob Begum should be instructed to prove the legality of her marriage in the Darul Quaza Court.On 8-2-1938, Mahboob Begum and her children filed a suit in the Darul Quaza Court which was a Court established under the law for deciding rights of succession, marriage, divorce etc. of the Muslims in the Hyderabad State, praying for a declaration that Mahboob Begum was the legally married wife of the Nawab and the children were his legitimate children, and for other consequential reliefs in the shape of participation in the matrooka and recovery of dower debt payable to Mahboob Begum. Ameerunnissa Begum and her children and Quadiran and her children were among the defendants impleaded in the suit.Written statements were filed by the defendants and also rejoinders by the plaintiffs, but before the suit could come up for hearing, a Firman was issued by the Nizam on 19-2-1939 on the application of Ameerunnissa directing the withdrawal of the suit from the Darul Quaza Court and the appointment of a Special Commission consisting of Nawab Jeewan Yar Jung, the then Chief Justice of Hyderabad and the Judge of Darul Quaza, before whom the suit was pending, to investigate the matter and submit a report to the Nizam through the Executive Co.",
        "9. The proceedings before the Special Commission commenced on 27-3-",
        "10. On 26-9-1939, Quadiran filed a plaint before the Commission on behalf of herself and her children wherein she claimed identical reliefs as were claimed by Mahboob Begum and her children. This plaint was at first rejected by the Commission but was subsequently entertained under a Firman dated 5-9-",
        "11. It appears that Fatimaunnissa also lodged a plaint in the Darul Quaza Court in respect of her dower against the estate of the Nawab and this matter was also directed to be investigated by the Commission.The inquiry before the Commission was a protracted affair in which a large mass of evidence both oral and documentary, was adduced. The Commission submitted its report on 16-10-",
        "12. They found that Mahboob Begum and Quadiran were both legally married wives of the Nawab, with the result that they and their children were entitled to participate in the distribution of the matrooka. Fatimaunnissa was also held to be a legally wedded wife of the Nawab and as such entitled to the dower claimed by her.When the report came up for consideration by the Executive Council, the members of the Council were divided in their opinion. A minority of the members was in favour of accepting the findings of the Commission forthwith but the majority view was that a further report should be obtained, before the Council could formulate its final recommendation. Eventually, on the advice of the Council, the Nizam directed by his Firman dated 27-8-1945, that the report of the Special Commission should be scrutinised by an Advisory Committee consisting of three persons, to wit, two Judges of the High Court and the Legal Adviser of the State.The instructions conveyed to the Committee in the Firman were that they should take no. further evidence and should not hear the parties and that what they were to consider was, whether having regard to the documents in writing of the late Nawab and other evidence adduced before the Commission, the three ladies could be held to be legally married wives or not. The three ladies referred to were Mahboob Begum, Quadiran and Fatimaunnissa.This Committee submitted its report on l4-11-1945, and their findings were that the marriage of Fatimaunnissa was proved but that the marriages of Mahboob Begum and Quadiran were not proved. On 20-3-1946, the Executive Council recommended that despite the report of the Committee, the findings of the Special Commission should be accepted and this recommendation was approved by the Nizam by a Firman dated 26-6-1947, which was communicated to Mahboob Begum and Quadiran Begum on 28-",
        "13. The Firman is in these terms :\"In this connection even after knowing the opinion of the advisers who were appointed to advise the members of the Council, the opinion of the majority of the Council is that the decision of the Commission is worthy of being implemented. So it should be implemented soon, because in this much delay has already occurred and the heirs are greatly worried waiting for the decision of the Commission.\"",
        "14. There was a petition by Mahboob Begum praying that the members of the Special Commission themselves should be asked to implement their findings but eventually it was decided by a Resolution of the Executive Council dated 22-9-1947, that the task of enforcing the recommendation of the Commission should be entrusted to the Chief Justice of the Hyderabad High Court. This Resolution is worded as follows :\"It has been unanimously resolved that for the execution of the report of the Commission there is a machinery existing in the High Court, through whom such matters can be completed. For this reason this matter may be entrusted to Mr. Abdul Hameed Khan, C. J., so that he may enforce the recommendations in the report of the Commission as early as possible.\"This was accepted by the Nizam and on 30-5-1948 a Firman was issued in the following terms :\"In accordance with the opinion of the Council the decision of the Commission may be entrusted to the Chief Justice for execution proceedings so that he may carry into effect the recommendations of the Commission as soon as possible.\"It appears that in subsequent communications to the Executive Council the Nizam expressed doubts regarding the status of Mahboob Begum and Quadiran Begum and suggested the replacement of the Firman of 26-6-1947 by new orders in the nature of a compromise. The Executive Council, however, stuck to their decision and finally on 3-6-1948, the findings of the Commission were transmitted to the Chief Justice for execution of the same as early as possible.On 28-6-1948, another Firman was issued by the Nizam to the effect that whatever report the Chief Justice may prepare in respect of the distribution of the matrooka he should obtain the sanction of the Nizam through the Council before carrying it into effect. This direction was embodied in a Resolution of the Executive Council dated 2-9-",
        "15. The Police Action in Hyderabad commenced soon after that and on 25-9-1948, after the Police Action had terminated and a Military Governor was placed in charge of the Hyderabad State, a formal communication of the Resolution made above was made to the Chief Justice.Soon afterwards, on the application of Ameerunnissa Begum made to the Military Governor the execution proceedings before the Chief Justice were stayed by an order dated 16-10-",
        "16. This stay order was again cancelled on 6-11-1948, and the execution proceedings were allowed to continue. On 2-12-1948, the Chief Secretary to the president of the Executive Council wrote a letter to the Chief Justice, enquiring of the latter by what time his report regarding distribution of the matrooka would be ready. In his reply dated 4-12-1948, the Chief Justice intimated that the report was almost ready and would be submitted in a day or two and on the day following the report was sent to the Executive Council of the Nizam.On 24-2-1949, however, a Firman was issued by the Nizam purporting to act under the advice of the Military Governor which directed that the finding of the Advisory Committee which differed from the views taken by the Special Commission should be given effect to; in other words the claims of Mahboob Begum and Quadiran Begum would stand dismissed and Ameerunnissa Begum was to pay Rs. One lakh to Fatimaunnissa as the dower due to the latter. The Firman concluded as follows :\"The matter is now finally decided and the case will not be reopened.\"In spite of the ostensible finality contained in this Firman, a further Firman was issued on 7-9-1949, which revoked the earlier Firman of 24-2-1949, and the whole case was referred for opinion and report to Sir George Spence, the Legal Adviser to the Military Governor, who was directed to hear the parties and take such further evidence as he considered necessary. The text of this Firman is as follows :\"In my Firman of 24-2-1949, which as stated therein was issued on the advice of the Military Governor, I directed that effect be given to the findings of the Legal Adviser Justice Qumar Hussain and Justice Abu Sayeed Mirza on the case of the succession to the late Wali-ud-Dowlah. The Military Governor for certain further reasons has now rendered further advice in accordance with which I revoke the direction given in the said Firman and direct the case to be referred for opinion and report to Sir George Spence, the Legal Adviser to the Military Governor, who will hear the parties and have discretion to take further evidence if he thinks fit.\"Enquiry then began before the Legal Adviser but neither party adduced any evidence. Sir George Spence submitted his report on -1-",
        "17. The material findings and recommendations in his report were as follows;P. 76 : My finding on the case is that neither Mahboob Begum nor Quadiran Begum was married to the Nawab with the result that these ladies and their children are not entitled to participate in the distribution of the Matrooka.P. 77 : If this finding is accepted, the order required for its implementation would be an order dismissing the claims of Mahboob Begum and Quadiran Begum on the Matrooka and directing Ameerunnissa Begum to pay Rs. One lakh out of the Matrooka to Fatimaunnissa on account of Haq Mehar.\"",
        "18. The Constitution of India came into force on 26-1-1950, and after the integration of Hyderabad with the Indian Union, the Nizam lost his absolute sovereign powers which he could exercise previously. It was, therefore, no. longer possible for him to issue a Firman in terms of the report of Sir George Spence. To obviate this difficulty, recourse was had to legislation and in April 1950, an Act was passed, known as Wali-ud-Dowlah Act (Succession Act), which purported to end the disputes regarding rights of succession to the matrooka or personal estate of the Nawab Wali-ud-Dowlah. Section 2(1) contained the material provisions of the Act and laid down that\"the claims of Mahboob Begum, Quadiran Begum and their children to participate in the distribution of matrooka of the late Nawab Wali-ud-Dowlah are hereby dismissed.\"The second clause of this section provided that a sum of Rs. One lakh was to be paid to Fatimaunnissa Begum on account of her dower.",
        "19. Section 3 further provided that the decision affirmed in S. 2 could not be called in question in any Court of law. The Act received the assent of the Nizam as Raj Pramukh of the State on 24-4-",
        "20. On 6-3-1950, Mahboob Begum and Quadiran Begum, together with their children, presented a petition before the High Court of Hyderabad under Art. 226 of the Constitution, praying for appropriate writs to quash the aforesaid Act on the ground of its provisions being in conflict with the fundamental rights of the petitioners under Arts. 14, 19 (1)(f) and 31 of the Constitution. This application was resisted by Ameerunnissa Begum and her children.The High Court by its judgment dated 7-11-1950 substantially accepted the contentions of the petitioners and declared the Act to be void so far as it affected their rights. Against this decision, Ameerunnissa Begum and her children took an appeal to this Court being C. A. No. 63 of 1952 reported as - Ameerunnissa Begum v. Mahboob Begum, AIR 1953 SC 91 (A). This Court dismissed the appeal basing its decision practically on one ground, namely that the provisions of the Act violated the fundamental rights of the respondents guaranteed under Art. 14 of the Constitution; and in this view it was considered unnecessary to decide the other points raised before the High Court.It may be mentioned here that the learned Judges of the High Court held inter alia in their judgment that there was a valid and operative decree in favour of Mahboob Begum, Quadiran Begum and their children based on the decision of the Special Commission, and one of the grounds on which the impugned Act was declared to be invalid was that this decree being property in the eye of law, the impugned Act had deprived the petitioners of their proprietary rights within the meaning of Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31 of the Constitution. This Court refrained from expressing any opinion upon this part of the judgment of the High Court and left the point open, particularly in view of the fact that the question of their being an effective and final decree in favour of the respondents was raised specifically by Ameerunnissa Begum and her children in the execution case started by the respondents which was awaiting decision before the City Civil Court of Hyderabad.As has been said above, it was in pursuance of the Firman of the Nizam, dated 30-5-1948, that the decision of the Special Commission was transmitted for implementation to the Chief Justice of the Hyderabad High Court. On 13-7-1948, Mahboob Begum, Quadiran Begum and their children presented an application for execution of this decree before the Chief Justice of the High Court and this execution case was pending when the Military Governor of Hyderabad by his order dated 16-10-1948, directed a stay of the execution proceedings. This order indeed was withdrawn on 5-11-1948, and the Chief Justice did proceed with his work after that and submitted his report on the 5th of December following, but shortly after that the Firman of 24-2-1949 came, which dismissed the claims of these two ladies and their children altogether.The events after that, leading up to the passing of the Wali-ud-Dowlah Succession Act which have been referred to already, prevented any further steps being taken in the execution proceedings. After the decision of the High Court was given on the writ petition and the Wali-ud-Dowlah Succession Act was declared invalid, a fresh petition was filed by Mahboob Begum, Quadiran Begum and their children on 12-3-",
        "21. At that time an appeal had already been taken by Ameerunnissa Begum and her children against the judgment of the High Court in the writ petition and the appellants had obtained a partial stay of execution proceedings on the basis of a consent order passed by this Court on 25-1-",
        "22. Consequently, in the application for execution filed on 12-3-1931, the prayer of the respondents was that the execution proceedings might be carried on subject to the order for partial stay made by this Court.This execution petition was transferred to the City Civil Court, Hyderabad, under the orders of the Chief Justice as the original side of the High Court where the execution proceedings were pending had been abolished under the provisions of the Abolition of Original Jurisdiction of the High Court Act. This application was resisted by Ameerunnissa Begum and her children and the contentions raised inter alia on the behalf were that there was no. effective decree in favour of the applicants at any time which was capable of being executed and even if there was any decree, it was destroyed by the Firmans of the Nizam, dated 24-2-1949 and 7-9-",
        "23. It was also contended that the City Civil Court had no. jurisdiction to execute the decree. The learned Judge of the any Civil Court rejected these objections and directed that execution should proceed. This order was passed on 5-2-1952, and Ameerunnissa Begum and her children took an appeal against this decision to the High Court of Hyderabad which was numbered Appeal No. 196/1 of 1951-",
        "24. As has been said already, on 9-12-1952, this Court dismissed the appeal filed by Ameerunnissa Begum and her children against the judgment of the High Court of Hyderabad in the writ proceedings. As a result of the dismissal of the appeal, the stay order was vacated and Mahboob Begum, Quadiran Begum and their children presented another application for execution in the City Civil Court in which the rest of their claims under the decree was included which was stayed during the pendency of the appeal in this Court. This petition was filed on 3-1-",
        "25. Ameerunnissa Begum and her children raised the identical objections against this application as they had raised in the earlier proceedings. The learned Judge of the City Civil Court took the matter as being concluded by his previous decision and dismissed these objections by an order dated 20-2-",
        "26. Against this order Appeal No. 190/1 of 1953 was taken by Ameerunnissa Begum and her children to the Hyderabad High Court.",
        "27. Alongside the first execution petition of Mahboob Begum and others, Fatimaunnissa Begum, the other admitted wife of the late Nawab, filed a petition for execution of her decree which she had obtained under the impugned Act and which had been declared to be subsisting by the High Court so far as her claim was concerned. To this execution petition also Ameerunnissa Begum and her children raised an objection and by a similar order dated 5-2-1932, the learned Judge of the City Civil Court dismissed the objections and directed execution to proceed.Against this order also, Ameerunnissa Begum and her children took an appeal to the Hyderabad High Court which was numbered Appeal No. 195 of 1951-",
        "28. These three appeals were heard together by the learned Judges of the High Court and were disposed of by one and the same judgment dated 21-1-",
        "29. The learned Judges affirmed the view taken by the City Civil Court and dismissed all the three appeals.It is against the judgment that Appeals Nos. 101 to 103 of 1954 have been brought to this Court. Of these, Appeals Nos. 101 & 103 arise out of the two execution proceedings commenced by Mahboob Begum, Quadiran Begum and their children, while Appeal No. 102 arises out of the execution proceedings started by Fatimaunnissa Begum.",
        "30. It may be mentioned at the outset that Appeal No. 102, which is directed against Fatimaunnissa Begum, has not been seriously pressed by the learned Attorney-General who appears for the aappellants in all the appeals. The appellants do not dispute that Fatimaunnissa Begum was legally married to Nawab Wali-ud-Dowlah and is entitled to a sum of Rs. One lakh as dower out of the personal estate of her husband. As a matter of fact, the appellants have already paid her the sum of Rs. One lakh out of the matrooka of the Nawab in their possession under the terms of the stay order, passed by this Court, on the application of the appellants at an earlier stage of the appeal.The learned Attorney-General made it clear that his clients have no. objection to Fatimaunnissa Begums recovering this amount in discharge of the dower debt admittedly due to her from the estate of the Nawab but they are not prepared to treat this as payment towards the so-called decree which is the subject-matter of these execution proceedings and the existence and validity of which they do not admit.The learned counsel appearing for Fatimaunnissa Begum expressed his readiness to accept the money in full satisfaction of the dower debt duo to his client and this position being accepted by both parties, there is no. other question which requires determination in this appeal. Whether Fatimaunnissa Begum is entitled to any share of the Matrooka, as wife of the deceased is another question and is not the subject-matter of the present proceedings and we do not express any opinion on this point at all."
