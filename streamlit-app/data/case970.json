(2) Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal is right in law and on facts of the case in holding that there is no transfer involved when the assessee gets itself registered under Para IX of the Companies Act, 1956? (3) Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal is right in law and on facts of the case in holding that the assessee is not liable to any capital gain tax either u/s 45(1) or 45(4) of the Income Tax Act? (4) Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal is right in law and on facts of the case in directing to delete the addition of Rs. 1,28,13,831?",

In our opinion, a the questions of law raised by the revenue before the High Court are substantial questions of law which arise from the order of the Tribunal. The High Court should have decided these questions by recording its findings thereon."
