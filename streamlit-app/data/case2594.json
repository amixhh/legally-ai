It is the appellants case that on account of some pressure brought on respondents S (Member (P) Telecom Commission) DOT and Respondent 6 (Advisor (T) Telecom Commission) DOT, the matter was referred by the 5th respondent to a High Level Committee, with a view to obtain an opinion disqualifying the appellant so that the Department could go in for an outmoded `analog system (rather than the current `digital system) to be provided by some multinational company which was wanting to dump its outmoded `analog system in the India. It is the appellants case that this was done with a view t enable the issue of a fresh notification calling for fresh tenders pertaining to `analog system. It appears that on",

These backdated minutes, it is alleged, were prepared as a ground for rejection of the tender, in spite of the fact that 5 years were spent on drafting the specifications and in the evaluation of bids.

        "59. The Department had already floated a tender for 20,000 lines for Digital Wireless local loop Systems for rural areas - for the entire country, including up. A copy of the Bid document was filed. It was alleged that the appellant, among other manufacturers, had also actively participated in the finalisation of the Technical Specifications of the new tenders. These specifications were slightly different from the earlier ADB tender and were based on latest `Generic Requirement (GR) prepared by the Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC) of the Department, after extensive consultation with the manufacturers. The bid document for this tender was no sale w.e.f.",
        "60. 1999 and 7 companies had already purchased the same and the tenders were educated to be opened on",

These telephones were expected to be installed by February, 199 in 17 Telecom Circles spread throughout the Country and these systems were more cost-effective that WLL system and were based on indigenous technology developed by M/s C-DOT.

One showed, District-wise, the number of villages identified for the earlier ADB tender and the villages provided with VPT out of the said villages. It was shown that out of 32,350 villages in UP Telecom Circle in UP Districts, 8524 villages out of the villages identified for ADB tender, (i.e. in Eastern UP) were already provided with telephones. A separate tabular statement was filed showing the progress of telephone installation in the rural sector right from",
        "64. As on",
        "65. 1998, the position is stated to be as follows : \"Assam and Nagaland -",
        "66. 3%; AP -",
        "67. 5%; As -",
        "68. 2%; Bihar -",
        "69. 2%; Gujarat -",
        "70. 8%; Haryana -",
        "71. 4%; Himachal Pradesh -",

        "82. 8%\". It will be noticed that the percentage of telephones in Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, J&K, North East and Orissa is less than the percentage is Eastern UP.",
        "83. These are the subsequent events that have taken place during the pendency of these matters in this Court. It will be noticed that these events have substantially changed the very basis of the original writ petition filed in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. The ADB loan on which the tender was based now stands withdrawn; the tenders for installing 38,000 telephones in Eastern UP stand withdrawn and invitations for new Tenders spread over several rural areas in various States have now been made. In fact, the new tenders have also been submitted. It is stated for the respondents that the appellant is also participating in these new tenders. We have, therefore, to decide this appeal in the light of the above subsequent developments.",
        "84. Learned Senior Counsel Sri D.D.Thakuar and Sri R.F. Nariman for the appellant and Senior Counsel Sri Rajeev Dhawan for the petitioner in the Transfer Petition have submitted that in spite of these developments, the question whether the various officers conspired and played fraud in seeing to it that the ADB loan lapsed or stood withdrawn, has still to be gone into. They contend that when the writ petition was filed on",
        "85. 1998, the positing was that with a view to allow multi-national companies to dump outmoded analog technology into India, the officers were wanting to float fresh tenders in which such analog technology could be made the basis of the tenders, either wholly or partly, that the said attempt was successfully thwarted by the appellant filing the writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana and that with a view to spite the appellant, the officers had all conspired and played fraud in having the ADB loan withdrawn and the ADB tender cancelled. This, according to the appellant, amounted to a fraud on the appellant and also on the people of Eastern UP and has to be investigated. The excuse put forward by the officers of DOT that ADB loan would be expensive was absurd inasmuch as there was a 5 years moratorium on interest and the interest rate was something like 4% and there were other very favourable terms. It was argued that there was no point in having such a beneficial loan withdrawn and spending funds of the Government of India. The learned Senior Counsel for appellant and for petitioner in the Transfer Petition contended that the scheme meant for a very backward area like Eastern UP could not be allowed to be frustrated in this manner.",
        "86. Alternatively, it was contended by the learned senior counsel for the appellant that the appellant had a legitimate expectation of a substantive nature, that, even if the Government wanted to put its own funds, the original tender notification would be processed for the benefit of Eastern UP. The respondents cannot change the policy to benefit the rural areas in the whole country and abandon the original tender notification for Eastern UP.",
        "87. Dr. Rajeev Dhawan for the petitioner in the Transfer Petition contended that fraud in private-law field was different from fraud in the public-law field. This Court should, therefore, decide whether these officials got the High Level Committee appointed only with a view to harm the appellant and whether the Committee was stage-managed by a few officers who had other motives. Learned counsel Sri Dhawan also contended that this was a case of legitimate expectation for the appellant in the civil appeal as also to the 36,000 villages in Eastern UP. The learned senior counsel for the State of Punjab Sri P.C. Jain also supported the case of the appellant on the ground that the appellant was its public sector undertaking.",
        "88. On the other hand, it was contended vehemently for the Union of India by Sri C.S. Vaidyanathan, the learned Additional Solicitor General of India, that there was absolutely no truth in the contention of the appellant that there was a conspiracy or fraud to shelve the ADB loan, or to bring in outmoded technology into India through certain favoured multinationals. According to him, there were two main defeats in the tender submitted by the appellant, one was a technical one and the other was the absence of proof of `proneness. Even though, final opportunity was given, the appellant having agreed to produce fresh certificate from China, (apart from the certificate initially filed) to prove `proveness of the system in that country - the appellant failed to do so. The High Level Committees proceedings, in fact, showed that it wanted to accept the appellants tender and it gave an opportunity to the appellant to make good the defects but the attitude of the appellant was not helpful and it was the inaction of the appellant that was the cause for the delay that led to a situation where the time limit set by the ADB came very close and was expiring. As there was no chance of the appellant curing the defects within the few days that were left, the ADB loan had to be withdraw. Photocopies of the entire departmental proceedings were placed before the Court to show that everything was done bona fide and the allegations of the appellant were wild and unsubstantiated. It was argued that there was no forgery or ante-dating of any minutes. Two files in the respective departments were moving simultaneously and there was absolutely no truth in the allegations of ante-dating the minutes. Now that the ADB loan stood withdrawn and the ADB tender had also fallen through, the writ petition had become totally infructuous. The Government of India decided to go on with its own funds and now a new policy decision was taken to benefit rural areas in the whole country and not merely the 35,000 villages in Eastern UP. This was because there were other rural areas in other States which were more backward then Eastern UP. In those places, the percentage of telephones was far less than in Eastern UP. In fact, fresh tenders have been called for it benefit the backward rural areas in the whole country and the new tenders are no longer confined exclusively to Eastern UP. A Tabular statement relating to the national figures regarding telephones is placed before the Court to show that thee are even more backward rural areas in some States where the percentage of telephone was less than in Eastern UP. The Government has, now plans to cover all backward rural areas in the country in he next few years and monies have also been allocated. All these details have been given in the additional affidavits and statements filed in the Court. There is no question of dumping outdated technology into India. The new tenders and the future schemes are based or on the latest `digital technology and not on the outmoded `analogy technology. The new government policies are wider and cannot be challenged in tis writ petition which had become infructuous. There is no proof of fraud either in private law or public law established. There can be no legitimate expectation in regard to the ADB loan contract and in any event the new policy is based on overriding considerations of public interest and cannot be questioned. The appeals are liable to be dismissed. It is also argued that there is no need to transfer the writ petition filed by Mr. OP Srivastava from the Allahabad High Court to this Court. That has also, it is stated, become infructuous.",
        "89. On these submissions, the following questions arise for consideration : (1) Whether, after the ABD loan for the contract for providing telephones for Eastern UP was withdrawn, it is necessary to give any finding on the question of alleged fraud or to grant any directions regarding the bids offered for the ADB contract ?(2) Whether, if initially the Government decided to fund the proposed contract for Eastern UP from its own resources, it was permissible for the Government to change its policy into one for providing telephones for rural areas in the entire country and whether the `legitimate expectation of the appellant in regard to the earlier notification required, this Court to direct that the notification for Eastern UP should be continued ?",
        "90. Point 1 The disputes between the parties, before the ADB loan was withdrawn, were (i) whether there was a conspiracy or fraud or other manouvre on the part of the DOT-officials to shelve the ADB loan to spite the appellant and bring in outmoded `analog technology through favoured multinationals and (ii) whether the appellant (a) complied with the technical specifications and (b) produced adequate proof of the `proveness of the system offered by the appellant i.e as to its successful implementation in China. A review of the facts and the subsequent events would show that the issues which were live when the writ petition of the appellant was pending in the High Court have ow lost all their relevance. The entire tender was based on the ADB loan. If the ADB loan itself has stood withdrawn, there is now no possibility of the ADB loan project for Eastern UP being started or completed. It will well nigh be impossible to issue any directions to the Union of India to seek a renewal of the lapsed loan or to issue any directions to continue the project for Eastern UP on the on the basis of ADB loan. Even so, learned senior counsel for the appellant and the petitioner in the Transfer petition have argued the case on merits as if the ADB loan were still above. We have been taken through reveal volumes of correspondence between the various departments, and the minutes of various officers and of the High Level Committee to prove arbitrariness in the non-acceptance of the appellants bid on two counts. We have heard these submissions very patiently but the point is whether this Court is to give findings on issues which have become non-issues now after the withdrawal of the ADB loan. We have given our anxious consideration to the various contentions raised on behalf of the appellant and the petitioner in the Transfer Petition and we are of the view that a detailed decision on the said questions is not called for. A question of fraud was also raised. But once the ADB loan is withdrawn the question has also becomes a non-issue. The position is that in respect of the ADB loan project, no fresh tenders based on `analog system have been invited nor has any multinational company been awarded any contract based on outmoded analog system. The said question of fraud is no longer relevant. On all these issues we should not be understood as having expressed any opinion. Further, there cannot be a cause of action on the basis of an \"attempt at fraud\" which did not materialise. It is true as stated in De Smith Administrative Law (para",
        "91. 010(5th Ed.) that it is fundamental to the legitimacy of public decision-making that official decisions should not be infected with motives such as fraud (or dishonesty) malice or personal self interest. Duty to act in good faith is inherent in the process. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner in the Transfer Petition, Sri Rajeev Dhavan referred to Shrisht Dhawan v. Shaw Brothers, 1992(1) SCC 534 where the distinction between fraud in public law and private law has been adverted to. But all these legal principles are not relevant if, the so called or alleged attempt at fraud did not fructify."
