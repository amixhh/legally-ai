He expressed his desire to visit Dr. Manjrekar on the next day. While he was watching TV, he again suffered an attack of migraine. He dashed his head on the wall. She then took him to Om hospital. In the meanwhile, accused no.2 had called on Mobile No.9405872061 and informed about his arrival at Pune. Her brother had asked him to come to Om hospital. Paramjit had refused to get admitted at Om hospital as he was taking treatment from Dr.Manjrekar. He was administered two injections. She had seen the accused nos.2 to 4 near ambulance.

        "72. That, the deceased had died because of a severe attack of migraine. The learned counsel for the appellants submits that on the instruction of her brother, accused no.1 had paid some amount to accused no.2 to return to Gwalior. That, she has been falsely implicated. It is further submitted that it is a case based on circumstantial evidence and it is incumbent upon the prosecution to establish the complete chain of circumstances. That the accused no.1 has examined herself as defence witness and due weightage has to be given to her evidence on oath and needs to be considered on par with the evidence of prosecution witnesses. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the appellants that there is delay in lodging FIR, which shows that a false case is concocted against the accused persons. It is true that P.W.1 has not offered any explanation for the delay in registration of crime, however, that by itself would not be fatal to the prosecution.",
        "73. The learned counsel for the appellants submits that the relations between the accused no.1 and her deceased brother were cordial and she had no motive to cause the death of her brother who was taking care of her. No poison was detected. The learned counsel for the appellants further submits that accused no.1 has candidly stated that her brother was like a father to her.",

        "76. 00 a.m onwards. That, at about",
        "77. 30 a.m, the accused nos.2 to 4 had left the house of the accused no.1 and the deceased and soon thereafter, the deceased had died. The cause of death was asphyxia due to throttling. The deceased was brought dead to the hospital and the information was given to the police by Sahyadri Hospital. That, there were bruises on the dead body of deceased Paramjit which were noticed and noted in the inquest panchanama as well as the postmortem notes. There was no reason for accused no.1 to disclose to P.W.6 that accused no.2 to accused no.4 were looking after her brother while he was admitted in Mangeshkar Hospital. This would show that she had a guilty mind as P.W.6 was not concerned with the same.",
        "78. The arrival of accused nos.2 and 3 from Gwalior to Pune is established by the seizure of railway tickets. They had arrived in Pune on 20th January 2013 and had departed from Pune for Gwalior on 26th January",
        "79. The railway tickets were seized on 3rd March 2013 at the time of their arrest.",
        "80. The evidence of P.W.2 Sachin clearly establishes that the cellphone no.8223088237 was registered in the name of accused no.",
        "81. The call details record further establishes that the accused no.1 was constantly in contact with accused no.",
        "82. The same is admitted by DW1 before the court.",
        "83. The material adduced by the prosecution at the trial leaves no room for doubt but to hold that the chain of circumstances is so complete that there is reasonable ground to conclude that it is inconsistent with the innocence of the accused. The accused no.1 has examined herself on oath and has given several admissions as has been discussed above. The admission coupled with the false explanation offered by the accused would by itself be an additional link which would complete the chain of circumstances. At this stage, it would be appropriate to refer to the case of Deonandan Misra Vs. State of Bihar 1955 AIR 801 . The Apex Court, in this case, has held thus :- It is true that in a case of circumstantial evidence not only should the various links in the chain of evidence be clearly established, but the completed chain must be such as to rule out a reasonable likelihood of the innocence of the accused. But in a case like this where the various links as stated above have been satisfactorily made out and the circumstances point to the appellant as the probable assailant, with reasonable definiteness and in proximity to the deceased as regards time and situation, and he offers no explanation, which if accepted, though not proved, would afford a reasonable basis for a conclusion on the entire case consistent with his innocence, such absence of explanation or false explanation would itself be an additional link which completes the chain. We are, therefore, of the opinion that this is a case which satisfies the standards requisite for conviction on the basis of circumstantial evidence.",
        "84. The horrendous death of a brother at the hands of a sister is a stigma on the pure relationship between a brother and sister. It is believed that one does not choose a family and a bond between brother and sister is a Gift of God. The present case destabilises this belief and shocks the conscience of the Court.",
        "85. The submission of the learned counsel that the accused no.1 had no motive to cause homicidal death of her brother and that a false case is foisted upon her cannot be taken into consideration.",
        "86. That absence of motive by itself is not sufficient to exonerate an accused for the charges framed against him. Motive is an inner urge that may force a person from doing an act or refraining from doing an act and an inference can be drawn on the basis of the act which is actually committed. The Blacks Law Dictionary defines motive as under :- Motive. Something, esp. willful desire, that leads one to act. - Also termed ulterior intent.",
        "87. The Apex Court, while deciding the case of Nanubhai Vastabhai Katariya vs. State of Gujarat 1999 SCC Online Guj.235 has placed reliance upon and considered the observations in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh through Central Bureau of Investigation Vs. Dr. Sanjay Singh and Anr. AIR 1994 SCC 1701 , which reads thus :",
        "88. At the highest, the prosecution can only suggest from the circumstances what is or may be the motive for any particular act. However, motive is not a sine quo non for bringing the offence of murder or of any crime home to the accused. At the same time the absence of ascertained motive comes to nothing, if the crime is proved to have been committed by a same person but to eke out a case by proof of a motive alone – that too suspicion of motive apparently tending towards any possible crime, is not only a very unsatisfactory but also a dangerous process, because circumstances do not always lead to particular and definite inferences and the inferences themselves may sometimes be erroneous.",
        "89. As against this, the learned APP has submitted that the transaction in which the deceased had died homicidal death would be within the special knowledge of accused no.1 alone since she had brought the deceased from Om hospital against medical advice. That, it is admitted by accused no.1 in her deposition that she was constantly in touch with the accused no.2 for almost three years prior to the death of her brother deceased Paramjit and more particularly between 20th January to 26th January",
        "90. Accused nos.2 and 3 had left Pune on 26th January 2013 i.e. soon after the incident. The identity of all the accused is established by the prosecution through P.W. Nos.2,3,5 and 6 and hence, according to the learned APP, the judgment of the trial Court calls for no interference.",
        "91. The conduct of accused no.1 during the prelude to the death of her brother, her association with accused nos.2 to 4 in the intervening night of 24th and 25th coupled with the false explanation offered by her before the Court leads to the logical inference that the accused no.1 had drawn a master plan to eliminate her brother for the best reasons known to her alone, and she was aided and assisted by accused nos.2 and accused no.3 in executing the plan. As far as accused no.4 is concerned, the evidence against him is weak. The witnesses have claimed to have identified him in Test Identification Parade but the identity was not established. Moreover, there is no evidence that he was in contact with accused no.1 to accused no.3 prior to the incident. His association with accused nos.2 and 3 also does not inspire confidence whereas the records show that accused no.2 was using the phone of accused no.3 to communicate with accused no.",
        "92. They had travelled from Gwalior to Pune and Pune to Gwalior together during that period. The complicity of accused no.4 in executing the plan sketched by accused no.1 is doubtful. He, therefore, deserves extension of benefit of doubt."
