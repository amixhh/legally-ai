However, petitioner shall make genuine endeavour to settle the matter with the remaining complainants in the present FIR. Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as and when he is called upon to do so.",
        "4. We are informed by the learned counsel appearing for the complainants that the said order was passed by the High Court without giving any notice to them. Moreover, on perusal of the impugned order, we find that the High Court has not indicated any reason to interfere with the order of Additional Sessions Judge, Saket Court, cancelling the interim bail granted to Respondent No.",
