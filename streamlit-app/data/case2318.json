        "1. Wanchoo, J.",
        "2. These four appeals on certificates granted by the High Court at Calcutta arise out of one judgment and will be dealt with together. The brief facts necessary for present purposes are these : In September, 1946, there was food shortage in the Country. In order to relieve this shortage, the Government of India entered into an agreement with the President of Argentine Institute for Promotion of Trade by which it undertook to freeze, requisition and take over and sell to the Argentine Institute and Ship to Argentine 30,000 tons of hessian and in return the Institute guaranteed to obtain licences for shipment from Argentine of maize and wheat offals already purchased by the Government of India in Argentine. This agreement was arrived at on September 27,",
        "3. In anticipation of this agreement, the Government of India on September 20, 1946, addressed letters to the managing agents of various jute mills in Bengal demanding from them information as to stocks of hessian of certain description held by the mills under their managing agencies and prohibiting them from selling, transferring, removing, consuming or otherwise disposing of any article enumerated in Sch. B to the communication. This demand was made under sub-rule (5) of R. 75A of the Defence of India Rules (hereinafter called the Rules). After the information had been gathered, the Government of India issued an order on September 30, 1946, to the same managing agents requisitioning the hessian specified in the schedule to the order and directing them and every other person in possession of the said property to deliver it to the Director of Supplies, Calcutta, and in the meantime not to dispose of the property in any manner without the permission of the Central Government. The schedule to the order in each case indicated the mill from which the requisition was made, the quantity, the description of the hessian and the name of the registered stock-holders. These requisition orders were served upon the managing agents of the mills under sub-rule (1) of R. 75A of the Rules on that very day. Thereafter on the same day, that is, September 30, 1946, the Government of India issued a notice under sub-rule (2) of R. 75A to the managing agents communicating that it had been decided to acquire the property under that sub-rule. The managing agents were further informed that by virtue of sub-rule (3) of R. 75A the said property would vest in the Central Government at the beginning of the day on which the notice was served upon them free from any mortgage, pledge, lien or other similar encumbrance. The notices of acquisition were accompanied by schedules similar to the schedules accompanying the requisition-orders. This notice of acquisition was also served on the same day on all the managing agents. Further on the same day the deputy Director of Supplies, Government of India, wrote to the Secretary, Indian Jute Mills Association, that shipping instructions would be issued in due course by the Director of Supplies, Calcutta, with respect to hessian requisitioned and acquired under the orders and notices already referred to. The Government then tried to take possession of the hessian requisitioned and acquired but the mills and the holders of delivery-orders resisted the Governments attempt on the ground that the orders of requisition and acquisition were invalid. The Government of India then filed the suit out of which the present appeals have arisen on December 11, 1946, for enforcing the orders of requisition and acquisition and also applied for a receiver to be appointed. This application was resisted and it became apparent that it would take some time before it could be disposed of. As ships which were to carry the hessian to Argentine were ready and shipment could not be delayed, the Government on January 7, 1947, promulgated an Ordinance, being Ordinance No. 1 of 1947, whereby notwithstanding the pendency of the suit the title and possession of the goods requisitioned and acquired were made to vest in the Government. The Government then took possession of the hessian and shipped the same to Argentine. The suit however did not became infructuous or unnecessary after this because S. 3 of the Ordinance provided that the suit should be proceeded with in regard to one question involved in it and decision thereon obtained. Under S. 3 it was provided that if in the suit it was finally decided that the said goods were of validly requisitioned or acquired by the Central Government on the 30th day of September, 1946, each of the several previous owners of the said goods would be entitled to receive as compensation from the Central Government the market price prevailing on the date of the institution of the aforesaid suit; but if no such decision was made in the suit the said goods would be deemed to have been validly requisitioned and acquired by the Central Government on the 30th September 1946, and the amount of compensation to be paid by the Central Government to the several previous owners of the said goods would be determined in accordance with the provisions of law in force on September 30, 1946, relating to the requisition and acquisition of movable property under the rules made under the Defence of India Act,",
        "4. It may be mentioned that the Defence of India Act, 1939, and the Rules made thereunder came to an end on September 30,",
        "5. The main question therefore which remained to be decided in the suit was whether the orders of requisition and acquisition were valid and binding on the respective defendants; and the suit was confined to obtaining a declaration to that effect. If a declaration was granted to the Government of India as prayed, the compensation would be determined as on September 30, 1946, in accordance with the provisions of law in force on that day relating to the requisition and acquisition of movable property under the rules made under the Defence of India Act,",
        "6. On the other hand, if no such declaration was granted, compensation would have to be arrived at in accordance with the market price of hessian prevailing on the date on which the suit was filed, i.e., December 11,",
        "7. The main questions which arose for determination in the trial court were four, namely-(1) Where the alleged orders of requisition dated September 30, 1946, mentioned in the plaint properly and/or validly and/or duly served? (2) Did such alleged orders effect any valid requisition of the goods mentioned in the Schedules to such orders? (3) Were the orders and notices of acquisition mentioned in the plaint properly made or given and/or duly served? (4) Is there any custom of trade practice or usage that upon delivery orders being made over to the buyers against payment the property in the goods represented by such delivery orders passed to such buyers?",
        "8. Sarkar, J. who tried the suit on the original side of the High Court held that the orders of requisition were properly and validly made. He further held that there was no service of the orders on the mills which were in possession of the hessian and which had to be served in order to effect a valid requisition. He therefore held that as there was no proper or due service of the orders there was no valid or binding requisition. Further on the question of acquisition he held that as the goods requisitioned and acquired were subject to pucca delivery orders and in view of the usage that pucca delivery order were only issued against payment, were passed from hand to hand by endorsement and were sold and dealt with in the market as absolutely representing the goods to which they relate and as the mills were estopped from challenging that the property in the goods had passed (see Anglo-India Jute Mills Co. v. Omademull, ILR 38 Cal 127 ) the Government which was claiming ownership through the mills was also subject to estoppel and as the holders of the delivery-orders being the owners of the property were not served on September 30, 1946, under R. 75-A(2) of the Rules, the property in the goods therefore did not pass on September 30,",
        "9. On this view the suit was dismissed.",
        "10. The Union of India then went in appeal. The appeal court reversed the view of Sarkar, J. on the question of requisition. It held that the requisition orders did affect and intended to affect individual mills and service on the managing agents of the mills was good service on the mills and therefore the orders of requisition were valid. On the question of acquisition the appeal court posed the question whether the notices of acquisition were served on the owners as required by R. 75-A (2). It did not agree with the view of Sarkar, J. that the government was claiming through the mills and were therefore estopped from challenging the title of the holders of delivery-orders. It also held that property in the goods could not pass by estoppel in the face of the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, III of",
        "11. Accordingly it held that it was not necessary to serve the holders of the delivery-orders with notices of acquisition; but it further held that the mills which were the owners of the goods requisitioned were not served with the notices of acquisition, as in its opinion strict compliance with the provisions of the rules in O. XXIX of the Code of Civil Procedure were necessary in order that transfer of ownership contemplated under R. 75-A of the Rules may be effected. Further as there was failure to comply strictly with the provisions of O. XXIX of the Code of Civil Procedure and as in the view of the appeal court R. 119 (1-B) of the Rules did not apply to the case, there was no service of notices of acquisition on the owners as required by R. 75-A (2) of the Rules; therefore it held that the acquisition was not valid. In the result the appeal was partly allowed as to the effect of the requisition orders but the view of Sarkar, J. was upheld as to the effect of notices of acquisition.",
        "12. This has been followed by four appeals on certificates granted by the High Court. Appeals Nos. 314 to 316 are by the defendants in the suit challenging the view of the appeal court that the orders of requisition were valid and binding. The appellants in these appeals will hereinafter be referred to as the defendants. Appeal No. 778 is by the Union of India challenging the view of the appeal court that the notices of acquisition were not properly served and therefore there was no acquisition of property on September 30, 1946, as provided by R. 75-A (3).",
        "13. We shall first deal with the three appeals by the defendants relating to the requisition-orders. It is necessary to set out Rr. 75A and 119 of the Rules in this connection, for the validity of the requisition orders depends upon whether the two rules have been complied with. The two rules are as follows :\"75-A (1) If in the opinion of the Central Government or the Provincial Government it is necessary or expedient so to do for securing the defence of British India, public safety, the maintenance of public order or the efficient prosecution of the war, or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community, that Government may by order in writing requisition any property, movable or immovable, and may make such further orders as appear to that Government to be necessary or expedient in connection with the requisitioning :Provided that no property used for the purpose of religious worship and no such property as is referred to in Rule 66 or in R. 72 shall be requisitioned under this rule.",
        "14. Where the Central Government or the Provincial Government has requisitioned any property under sub-rule(1), that Government may use or deal with the property in such manner as may appear to it to be expedient, and may acquire it by serving on the owner thereof, or where the owner is not readily traceable or the ownership is in dispute, by publishing in the official gazette, a notice stating that the Central or Provincial Government, as the case may be, has decided to acquire it in pursuance of this rule.",
        "15. Where a notice of acquisition is served on the owner of the property or published in the official gazette under sub-r. (2), then at the beginning of the day on which the notice is so served or published, the property shall vest in Government free from any mortgage, pledge, lien or other similar encumbrance, and the period of the requisition thereof shall end.",
        "16. x x x x119 (1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in these Rules, every authority, officer or person who makes any order in writing in pursuance of any of these Rules shall, in the case of an order of a general nature or affecting a class of persons, publish notice of such order in such manner as may, in the opinion of such authority, officer or person, be best adapted for informing persons whom the order concerns, in the case of an order affecting an individual corporation or firm serve or cause the order to be served in the manner provided for the service of a summons in R. 2 of Order XXIX or R. 3 of Order XXX as the case may be in the First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), and in the case of an order affecting an individual person (not being a corporation or firm) serve or cause the order to be served on that person-(i) personally, by delivering or tendering to him the order, or(ii) by post, or(iii) where the person cannot be found, by leaving an authentic copy of the order with some adult male member of his family or by affixing such copy to some conspicuous part of the premises in which he is known to have last resided or carried on business or personally worked for gain.(1-A) Where any one of these Rules empowers an authority, officer or person to take action by notified order, the provisions of sub-rule (1) shall not apply in relation to such order.(1-B) If in the course of any judicial proceeding, a question arises whether a person was duly informed of an order made in pursuance of these Rules, compliance with sub-rule (1), or, in a case to which sub-rule (1-A) applies, the notification of the order, shall be conclusive proof that he was so informed; but a failure to comply with sub-rule (1)-(i) shall not preclude proof by other means that he had information of the order; and(ii) shall not affect the validity of the order.\"The scheme of R. 75-A (1) which provides for requisitioning is that the Government has to form an opinion whether it is necessary or expedient to make a requisition for securing the defence of British India, public safety, the maintenance of public order or the efficient prosecution of the war or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community. After such opinion has been formed, the Government may by order in writing requisition any property, movable or immovable, and make such further orders as appear to it to the necessary or expedient in that connection. It has been faintly urged on behalf of the defendants that the orders of requisition were invalid as they did not comply with first condition indicated above, namely, the necessity or expediency of passing the order. It is enough to say that there is nothing in this contention. The order of September 30, 1946, states in so many words that \"in the opinion of the Central Government it is expedient for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community\" to make a requisition. It has never been the case of the defendants that the orders of requisition were passed mala fide. In these circumstances, in the absence of mala fides, the opinion of the Government is final and the purpose indicated by it in the orders for making requisitions is one of the purposes for which an order of requisition can be made under R. 75-A.",
        "17. The main contention of the defendants in their appeals is that R. 75-A contemplates that the order of requisition must be brought to the knowledge of the person whose interests are being affected by it and that this was not done in this case, for neither the holders of delivery orders nor the mills were apprised of the orders of requisition on September",
        "18. Therefore, it is urged that the orders of requisition were not valid and binding. Now sub-rule (1) of R. 75-A does not specifically provide for the manner in which an order of requisition is to be served, nor does it provide specifically on whom such an order should be served. So far as the person on whom an order of requisition should be served is concerned, we agree with the appeal court that service of such an order is necessary on the person who can place the goods in question at the disposal of the requisitioning authority and until that is done there cannot be any valid and effective requisition. This is also clear from the definition of the word \"requisition\" in R. 2 (11) of the Rules, for \"requisition\" means in relation to any property, to take possession of the property or to require the property to be placed at the disposal of the requisitioning authority. Therefore, a requisition of property can be effected either by taking possession of the property or by requiring the property to be placed at the disposal of the requisitioning authority. In the present case we are concerned with the second mode of requisition. In such a case it is necessary that the party which is required to place the goods in question at the disposal of the requisitioning authority should be informed of the order of requisition, so that it may place the property at the disposal of the requisitioning authority as required by the order. Three questions therefore immediately arise in this connection, namely, (i) who were the proper persons on whom orders of requisition should have been served, (ii) what is the manner in which the orders should have been served, and (iii) whether proper persons have been served in the proper manner in this case.",
        "19. So far as an order of requisition is concerned, we are of opinion that there is no question of any service of the order on the holders of delivery orders, for whatever may be their position as to the ownership of the goods (a matter with which we shall deal later when considering the matter of acquisition), they were admittedly not in possession of the goods on September",
        "20. Further the goods were admittedly in the possession of the mills and therefore the proper persons to be served with the orders of requisition in this case were the mills.",
        "21. The next question is as to the manner in which the mills which were in possession of the goods had to be served. To that the answer is in our opinion to be found in R. 119 of the Rules. Rule 119(1) provides that save as otherwise expressly provided in these rules, every order in writing in pursuance of any of these rules shall be served in the manner provided therein. Now there is no express provision as to the manner in which an order of requisition in writing issued under R. 75-A has to be served; therefore it has to be served as provided in R. 119(1). Further, as orders in this case concerned an individual corporation they had to be served in the manner provided for service of summons in R. 2 of O. XXIX of the Code of Civil Procedure. Rule 2 of O. XXIX provides that where the suit is against a corporation, the summons may be served on the secretary, or on any director, or other principal officer of the corporation, or by leaving it or sending it by post addressed to the corporation at the registered office or if there is no registered office then at the place where the corporation carries on business. We have therefore to see whether the mills were served with the orders of requisition in the manner provided by R. 2 of O. XXIX of the Code of Civil Procedure. Further in case there is any irregularity in service it will have to be seen whether the matter comes under sub-rule (1-B) of R.",
        "22. Let us therefore first examine the question whether the mills were served as provided in O. XXIX, R.",
        "23. Now the orders of requisition were sent to the managing agents of the various jute mills. It is true that in the heading of the order, though the name of the managing agency corporation was mentioned, it was not specifically stated there that the order was being addressed to it as the managing agents for such and such mills. But when one reads the schedule attached to each order sent to the managing agents, it becomes immediately clear that the order was intended for the mills mentioned in the schedule and was being served on the managing agents of the mills. As an instance, we may refer to one requisition order addressed to Messrs. Thomas Duff and Co. Ltd. In the schedule it was clearly stated that the order was with respect to jute bales held by the jute mills under the managing agency of the addressee and the names of the jute mills with respect to which the order was passed and was being communicated to the managing agents were also mentioned, that is, Titaghur, Victoria, Samnaggur (South) and Samnaggur (North) Jute Mills. Any one receiving this order should be therefore able immediately to understand that the order was served on Messrs. Thomas Duff and Co. Ltd. as the managing agents of the four jute mills mentioned above. The defect therefore in the form of address was in our opinion of no consequence. The order read as a whole along with the schedule leaves no doubt that the order was meant for the jute mills mentioned in the schedule and was addressed to Messrs. Thomas Duff and Co. Ltd. as the managing agents of those jute mills. It is not in dispute that orders of requisition with respect to other mills addressed to other managing agents were in the same form and contained similar schedules. There can therefore in our opinion be no doubt that the orders of requisition were meant for the mills and were addressed to them through the managing agents. It is not in dispute that those orders were served on the managing agents on September 30, 1946, and the only question therefore that remains to be considered is whether the service on the managing agents on behalf of the mills is proper service as provided in R. 119(1) of the Rules read with R. 2 of O. XXIX of the Code of Civil Procedure.",
        "24. In the matter of service, we are concerned with cl. (a) of O. XXIX, R. 2, which provides that summons may be served on the secretary, or on any director or other principal officer of the corporation; and what we have to see is whether service on the managing agents was service on \"other principal officer\" of the corporation. Section 2(11) of the Indian Companies Act, NO. VII of 1913, which was in force at the relevant time, defines an \"officer\" to include any director, managing agent, manager or secretary. So a managing agent of a corporation is an officer of the corporation. The question then is whether he is a principal officer, and the answer to our mind is obvious, considering the nature of the duties of a managing agent of a corporation. It is not seriously disputed either that if a managing agent is an officer of the corporation, he would, considering the nature of his duties, be a principal officer. What is, however, contended is that the definition of an officer given in the Companies Act is an artificial definition and is only for the purposes of the Companies Act and not for the Code of Civil Procedure. The appeal court did not accept this contention and was of the opinion that the definition of an officer given in the Companies Act can also be utilised for the purpose of the Code of Civil Procedure and we think that that view is correct. Therefore, when the service in this case was effected on the managing agents of the mills it was effected on one of the principal officers of the corporation and would be a good service under O. XXIX, R.",
        "25. But it is contended that the intention behind O. XXIX, R. 2, is that the service must be on a human being and that O. XXIX, R. 2, does not contemplate service on one corporation for the purpose of securing service on another corporation. In this connection reliance is placed on Rr. 1 and 3 of O. XXIX where it is urged that the same words occur and it is clear that these rules contemplate that the other principal officer mentioned therein must be a human being. This contention was urged before the appeal court and was rejected by it-and in our opinion, rightly. It is true that under Rr. 1 and 3 the principal officer envisaged must be a human being, but that conclusion follows from the setting in which these words appear in these two rules. Rule 1 relates to the signature and verification of a pleading by the secretary, director or other principal officer of the corporation while R. 3 provides that a court may require the personal appearance of the secretary or of any director or other principal officer of the corporation. It is obvious therefore from the setting in which the words \"other principal officer\" appear in these two rules that he must be a human being, for signature and verification in one case and personal appearance in another can only be by a human being. But Rr. 1 and 3 do not define who a principal officer is. Therefore, even though in these two rules a principal officer must be a human being, it does not follow that in R. 2 also he must be a human being. Rule 2 relates to service and cl. (b) thereof clearly shows that the service to be effected need not necessarily be on a human being connected with the corporation, for under cl. (b) the service will be effective if the summons is left or sent by post addressed to the corporation at the registered office or if there is no registered office then at the place where the corporation carries on business.Therefore, for service to be effective it is not necessary that summons must be served on some human being connected with the corporation. Nor do we see anything in O. XXIX which would militate against our holding that the service on one corporation may be made by serving another corporation which may be the principal officer of the first corporation. Once it is clear in view of the definition of an \"officer\" in S. 2(11) of the Companies Act that a managing agent is an officer and when it is obvious considering the nature of the duties of a managing agent of the corporation that it must be held to be a principal officer, service on the managing agent of a corporation would be effective service for the purpose of O. XXIX, R.",
        "26. We therefore agree with the appeal court that the orders of requisition in this cases having been undoubtedly served on the managing agents of the mills as such there has been proper service of the said orders on the mills as required by R. 119 of the Rules. Therefore as the service on the mills through the managing agents was good service within the meaning of R. 119 read with O. XXIX, R. 2, it is unnecessary to consider the further question whether it is good service within the meaning of R. 119(1-B)."
