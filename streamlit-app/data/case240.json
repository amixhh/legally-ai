        "59. 2001 and imposed additional tax on the assessee for the assessment year 2001-",

        "70. 1986 and accordingly repelled the stand of the assessee.",
        "71. We have heard Mr. S. Ganesh, learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr. Jatinder Kumar Bhatia, learned counsel for the respondent.",
        "72. The seminal issue that arises for consideration, succinctly put, is whether the appellant is entitled to dual benefit of partial exemption under the notification dated",
        "73. 1986 and also the lower rate of tax @ 6% under notification dated",
        "74. To answer the issue raised, it is necessary to refer to the notifications and the language employed therein to ascertain the fundamental intention therein and to appreciate whether grant of simultaneous exemptions and benefits would be contrary to the said notifications. The first notification dated",
        "75. 1986 reads as under:- “ Notification No.F.4(72)FD/Gr.IV/81-18, S.O. 23, May 6,",
        "76. In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (5) of section 8 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956( Central Act 74 of 1956), the State Government, on being satisfied that it is necessary so to do in the public interest, in supersession of the Finance Department Notification No. F.4 (72) FD/Gr. IV/81-36, dated December 3, 1985, hereby directs that, with immediate effect, any dealer, having his place of business and manufacturing goods in the State of Rajasthan, may claim partial exemption from the tax payable in respect of the sales by him of such goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce by way of reduction at the rate of 50% of the tax so payable on increased sales upto 50% and at the rate of 75% of the tax so payable on increased sales made over and above the aforesaid 50%, in the manner and subject to the conditions as follows:-(1) Such reduction of tax shall be allowed to a dealer only after and in respect of the increase which is effected in the percentage of the quantum of goods sold in the course of inter-State trade or commerce out of the total quantum of goods sold within the State and in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and dispatched to Head Office, Branch Office, Depot or agent outside the State for sale outside the State, during any accounting year as against such percentage during the accounting year 1984-",

        "79. The notification dated",
        "80. 2000 is as under:- “[No.F.4(1) FD/Tax Div. 97-266] Jaipur, 21 s t January, 2000In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (5) of section 8 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 the State Government being satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do, hereby directs that the tax payable under sub-sections (1) and (2) of the said section, by any dealer having his place of business in the State, in respect of sale of cement made by him from any such place of business in the State, in the course of inter-state trade or commerce, shall be calculated at the rate of 6% on the following conditions, namely:-",
        "81. That the dealer shall record the correct name with full and complete address of the purchaser in the bill or cash memorandum for such inter-State sale to be issued by him;",
        "82. That the burden of proof that the transaction was in the nature of inter-State sale shall be on the dealer; and",
        "83. That the dealer making inter-State sales under this notification shall not be eligible to claim benefits provided by notification No.F.4(72) FD/GR.IV/81-18 dated",
        "84. 1986 as amended from time to time.”",
        "85. On a careful scanning of the notification dated",
        "86. 1986, it is evident that it allows partial exemption from sales-tax on inter-State sales, subject to and in the manner stipulated therein. The exemption of 75% or 50% is granted with reference to the quantum of goods sold in the course of inter-State trade or commerce out of the total quantum of goods sold within the State, as against such percentage during the accounting year 1984-85, which is treated as the base year. As per the notification, it is applicable to a dealer who has his place of business; and he must be manufacturing goods inside the State. The intention is to encourage inter-State sale of goods manufactured and sold by a dealer in the State of Rajasthan. It has a purpose. The increase in quantum of goods sold in inter-State trade or commerce with reduction in quantum of stock transfers by way of branch or depot transfers on which NIL or no Central Sales tax is applicable would increase the revenue of the State. Clause 4 of the notification envisages that no reduction of tax is to be allowed in respect of levy cement. Computation of the total quantum of goods with reference to the exclusion of levy cement is not a subject matter of the present appeal and that is pending for consideration before the Appellate Bench and Single Judge of the High Court. Nevertheless, it is apparent that changes in figures of the quantum of goods, whether with reference to inter-State sales and intra-State sales in the base year and in the year in which benefit is claimed, would impact the determination and quantification of the benefit. Therefore, the exclusion or inclusion in the quantum or turnover is critical and significant.",
        "87. The",
        "88. 2000 notification applies to a dealer having a place of business in the State and is in respect of sale of cement made by him from any place of business within the State in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. Apart from the above, certain other conditions are to be satisfied. They are (a) sales-tax in respect of inter-State sales as per the notification would be calculated at the rate of 6% and (b) the dealer making inter-State sales under notification dated",
        "89. 2000 would not be eligible to claim benefit provided in the notification dated",
        "90. Clause 3 of the notification lays down that if a dealer claims benefit under notification dated",
        "91. 2000, he is not eligible to claim the benefit under notification dated",
        "92. Benefit under the two notifications cannot be claimed at the same time. It is simple and clear.",
        "93. A dealer making inter-State sales under the notification dated",
        "94. 2000 is disqualified and not eligible to claim benefit under the notification dated",
        "95. The reason is to deny dual benefit and also the notification dated",
        "96. 1986 computes the benefit on the basis of turnover. Bifurcation and division of turnover would lead to distortion and cause anomalies.",
        "97. To get over the aforesaid impasse, the learned counsel for the appellant has raised three contentions. The two notifications being beneficial should be liberally construed, for it cannot be assumed that the intendment was that if an assessee claims and was entitled to a relatively small or partial exemption under notification dated",
        "98. 1986, he would be deprived of the exemption even if he meets the conditions in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the notification dated",
        "99. The submission is that the assessee can get benefit of both the notifications but not the dual benefit in the sense that inter-State sales on which benefit of concessional rate of tax of 6% is not availed of could be granted partial exemption under notification dated",
        "100. Quite apart from the aforesaid argument, it is urged that partial exemption could be granted under the notification dated",
        "101. 1986 in respect of such intra- State sales not covered by the notification dated",
        "102. 2000; and benefit of partial exemption under notification dated",
        "103. 1986 would co-exist with the notification dated",
        "104. 2000, though in respect of different and distinct transactions. The second limb of argument is that this interpretation was the understanding of the respondents, as they had issued circular dated",
        "105. 1994 and pursuant to the said circular, the appellant and the other assessees were extended benefit of the notification dated",
        "106. 1986 and also the notification dated",
        "107. 1994, which has now been replaced and re-introduced in the form of notification dated",
        "108. The plea of consistency especially when the revenue in earlier years had accepted the said interpretation is highlighted. The last plank of argument is the circular dated",
        "109. 1994 was clarificatory and had rightly interpreted and expounded the interplay between the two notifications. Therefore, the circular dated",
        "110. 1994 under the notification dated",
        "111. 1994 would equally apply and would guide the interpretation of the notification dated",
        "112. In order to appreciate the contentions raised, it is imperative to reproduce notification dated",
        "113. 1994 and the circular dated",
        "114. 1994, and the circular dated",

        "159. 1994 was valid between 1st April, 1994 up to 31st March, 1997 (upto 31st March, 1997 vide notification dated",
        "160. 1997) and not thereafter. The Commercial Tax Department, by a circular, could have extended the benefit under a notification and, therefore, principle of estoppels would apply, though there are authorities which opine that a circular could not have altered and restricted the notification to the determent of the assessee. Circulars issued under tax enactments can tone down the rigour of law, for an authority which wields power for its own advantage is given right to forego advantage when required and considered necessary. This power to issue circulars is for just, proper and efficient management of the work and in public interest. It is a beneficial power for proper administration of fiscal law, so that undue hardship may not be caused. Circulars are binding on the authorities administering the enactment but cannot alter the provision of the enactment, etc. to the detriment of the assessee. Needless to emphasise that a circular should not be adverse and cause prejudice to the assessee. (See : UCO Bank, Calcutta v. Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal ((1999) 4 SCC 599 ).",
        "161. In Commissioner of Central Excise, Bolpur v. Ratan Melting and Wire Industries (2008) 13 SCC 1 ), it has been held that circulars and instructions issued by the Board are binding on the authorities under respective statute, but when this Court or High Court lays down a principle, it would be appropriate for the Court to direct that the circular should not be given effect to, for the circulars are not binding on the Court. In the case at hand, once circular dated",

        "163. 2001, the appellant-assessee cannot claim the benefit of the withdrawn circular.",
        "164. The controversy herein centres round the period from 1st April, 2001 to 31st March,",
        "165. The period in question is mostly post the circular dated",
        "166. As we find, the appellant-assessee has pleaded to take benefit of the circular dated",
        "167. 1994, which stands withdrawn and was only applicable to the notification dated",
        "168. It was not specifically applicable to the notification dated",
        "169. The fact that the third paragraph of the notification dated",
        "170. 2000 is identically worded to the third paragraph of the notification dated",
        "171. 1994 but that would not by itself justify the applicability of circular dated",
        "172. In this context, we may note another contention that has been advanced before us. It is based upon the doctrine of contemporanea exposition. In our considered opinion, the said doctrine would not be applicable and cannot be pressed into service. Usage or practice developed under a statute is indicative of the meaning prescribed to its words by contemporary opinion. In case of an ancient statute, doctrine of contemporanea exposition is applied as an admissible aid to its construction. The doctrine is based upon the precept that the words used in a statutory provision must be understood in the same way in which they are usually understood in ordinary common parlance by the people in the area and business. (See : G.P. Singh’s Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 13th Edition-2012 at page 344). It has been held in Rohitash Kumar and others v. Om Prakash Sharma and others (2013) 11 SCC 451 ) that the said doctrine has to be applied with caution and the Rule must give way when the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous. On a careful scrutiny of the language employed in paragraph 3 of the notification dated",
        "173. 2000, it is difficult to hold that the said notification is ambiguous or susceptible to two views of interpretations. The language being plain and clear, it does not admit of two different interpretations.",
        "174. In this regard, we may state that the circular dated",
        "175. 1994 was ambiguous and, therefore, as long as it was in operation and applicable possibly doctrine of contemporanea exposition could be taken aid of for its applicability. It is absolutely clear that the benefit and advantage was given under the circular and not under the notification dated",
        "176. 1994, which was lucid and couched in different terms. The circular having been withdrawn, the contention of contemporanea exposition does not commend acceptation and has to be repelled and we do so. We hold that it would certainly not apply to the notification dated",
