        "9. As per the appointment order, the respondent has to execute a bond to the effect that he would serve at least for two years as Pilot in Tuticorin Port Trust. From the language and the tenor of the said appointment letter it is patently clear that the appointment was a regular appointment against a permanent post which was to continue subject to the respondent qualifying in the examination of Pilot licence.

        "16. We have heard Mr. Parag Tripathi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants along with Mr. Keshav Thakur as well as Mr.A. Mariarputham, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent and perused the impugned judgment and materials on record.",

        "18. The objection raised regarding the appointment of the respondent is that he was holding certificate of competency as Master issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore which is not treated as equivalent of the certificate granted by the Government of India.

        "19. 2014 No. NT/ENGG. 02 of 2014, as per which the Directorate had taken a decision to permit Australia, Singapore, Ireland and New Zealand Certificate of competency (CoC) holders of Indian nationality to sail on Indian Flag vessels. It is, therefore, the contention of the appellants that prior to",
        "20. 2014 the CoC issued by Singapore was not recognized by th Government of India. It was, therefore, submitted that the respondent possessing certificate of competency issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore was not eligible to be appointed on regular basis and, therefore, his service was rightly terminated and the High Court erred in directing reinstatement.",
        "21. Our attention has been drawn by learned senior counsel Mr. A. Mariarputham appearing on behalf of the respondent to the advertisement issued for the post of Pilot Officer in response to which the respondent has appeared. The said advertisement for the Pilot Officer reads as under: Vacancy - 1 No. of Pilot Officer Qualification & Experience: Certificate of Competency as Master (FG) with minimum three years experience as Chief Officer.

        "22. It is to be pointed out that in the advertisement it was not indicated that the candidate should have a certificate of competency issued by the authorities which are recognized by the Government of India. In the case of the respondent, the Tuticorin Port Trust had sent a letter to the Ministry of Shipping dated",
        "23. 2008 stating that the respondent is in possession of certificate of competency issued by the Maritime Authority of Singapore and requesting to issue a positive clarification which may help the appellants to engage the respondent as Pilot in the appellants Port on a regular basis.

He has a record of Sea Service as Master Mariner at different spell from",
        "25. 2003 to",
        "26. After his appointment as Pilot in this Port he is being provided with necessary training so as to acquire knowledge in handling ships in the Port Waters. By Virtue of his experience in foreign going vessel, he is having high knowledge in the shipping operations and his performance in the field is apparently excellent. It is, therefore, requested that taking into account the factual position as brought out in para 2 & 3 above, to issue a positive clarification, which may help to engage, Capt. Paul Nadar Bennet Singh as Pilot in this Port on a regular basis, by accepting the competency Certificate issued by the Maritime Authority of Singapore (a common wealth country).",
        "27. The Government of India in its communication dated",
        "28. 2010 asked the appellants to clarify whether the certificate of competency as Master (Foreign going) issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is a valid qualification for undertaking pilotage duties at Tuticorin Port Trust as per relevant regulations/recruitment rules.",
        "29. In the clarification sought for by the appellants in the communication dated",
        "30. 2011 the Deputy Nautical Advisor has clarified the same as under: 1) Singapore is a white list country with IMO which means that it has been recognized by IMO to have given full compliance to STCW Convention 1978 (as amended). 2) Certificate of Competency as Deck Officer Class I (Master Mariners) issued by Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is not recognized under the provisions of Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (as amended), as well as STCW 78/95 Regulation 1/10 to command an Indian Ship as on date. 3) As regard to recognize the CoC issued by PSA, Singapore for pilots working in your port, you may be guided by the port regulations.",
        "31. The Deputy Nautical Advisor has thus clarified that the appellants may be guided by their Port Regulations. As pointed out earlier, as per Tuticorin Port Regulations, 1979, the qualification of candidates for pilot license is to possess certificate of competency as Master (Foreign going) granted by the Government of India or its equivalent. Regulation 6 reads as under:",
        "32. Qualification of Candidates-(1) A candidate for a Pilotage License shall: (a) be in possession of a certificate of competency as Master (foreign-going) granted by the Government of India or its equivalent and should have, preferably, experience of at least six months as First Mate, on a foreign-going ship;.......................... As seen from the above even as per the Regulations of the appellants-Port Trust, the qualification for pilot license is the possession of the certificate of competency as Master (foreign-going) granted by the Government of India or its equivalent. Neither at the time of the appointment of the respondent or subsequently that appellants - Port Trust had raised any objection that Certificate of Competency granted by Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore was not equivalent to the CoC granted by the Government of India. In fact, the letter of appointment which we have extracted above, the appointment is subject to the condition that the respondent should qualify in the examination for issue of pilot license to perform duties in Tuticorin Port Trust. In the impugned judgment, the Division Bench has pointed out the respondent has passed the examination for issuance of pilot license on",
        "33. No exception would be taken for the eligibility of the respondent to continue as the pilot officer in the appellants-Port Trust.",
        "34. In the light of the clarification given by the Deputy Nautical Advisor the contention of the appellants that CoC issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore cannot be taken as a recognized one by the Government of India, in our view, has no substance. This is all the more so, in the light of letter sent by appellants dated",
        "35. 2008 expressing satisfaction over the experience and knowledge of the respondent in the shipping operation. It is also to be pointed out that the respondent has been allowed to perform duties and also the fact that in the appointment order it is stated that the appointment is on regular basis."
