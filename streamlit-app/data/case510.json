        "97. 1990 was not validly made in accordance with law?",
        "98. The copy of the appointment order of the appellant has been placed on record as Annexure¬ P1, which mentions that appointment of the appellant has been made on he being selected by Selection Committee constituted as per provisions of The Subordinate Offices Ministerial Staff (Direct Recruitment) Rules, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as 1985 Rules). The appointment letter contains endorsement to the District Employment Officer. The material has been brought on record that the respondent No.1 has written to District Employment Officer on",
        "99. 1990 in reference to names of twelve candidates forwarded by the Employment Exchange with respect to the post of Junior Accounts Clerk which clearly indicate that names were sought from Employment Exchange before holding selection. Rules 22 and 23 of 1985 Rules provides for procedure of notification of vacancies to the examination and procedure of selection. Rule 22 is as follows: ¬ Notification of Vacancies to the Employment Exchange. ¬ The appointing Authority shall determine the number of vacancies to be filled during the course of the year as also the vacancies to reserved under Rule",
        "100. The vacancies shall be notified to the Employment Exchange. The Appointing Authority may also invite application directly from the person who have their names registered in the Employment Exchange. For this purpose, the Appointing Authority shall issue an advertisement in a local daily news paper besides pasting a notice for the same on the Notice Board. All such application shall be placed before the Selection Committee.",
        "101. The appellants case is that apart from calling names from the Employment Exchange, the respondent No.1 had also published an Advertisement on",
        "102. 1990 in the Daily News Paper Dainik Devvrat. The learned counsel for the respondents has refuted the claim of appellant of publication in the Daily News Paper. He submits that Editor of News Paper vide his letter dated",

        "106. There is no denial on the part of the respondents that the names were called from the Employment Exchange by the appointing authority before conducting the selection and the Employment Exchange had forwarded the twelve names which also included the name of appellant. The appointment of the appellant having been made by Selection Committee constituted under Statutory Rules after calling the names from Employment Exchange, the appointment cannot be said to have been made in disregard to the Statutory Rules.",
        "107. More so in the present case, there was no challenge to the appointment by any candidate nor any proceedings were initiated by the appointing authority questioning the appointment of the appellant.

        "109. Learned Single Judge without taking into consideration the facts of constitution of Selection Committee, calling the names from Employment Exchange has made observations that no procedure known to law namely Publication of Notification etc. was adopted which cannot be approved. Without having full aspect of the matter, no such observation ought to have been made by learned Single Judge more so when the appointment was not questioned either by any candidate or by appointing authority by initiating any process.
