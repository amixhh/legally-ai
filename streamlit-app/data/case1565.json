        "2. This appeal is directed against the order dated",
        "3. 2004 passed by learned Single Judge of High Courtof Jharkhand at Ranchi in Writ Petition No.3666 of 2001 whereby the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition following the decision given by the Division Bench of the Jharkhand High Court in Chatradhar Mahto & Ors. V. State of Jharkhand & Ors.",
        "4. Brief facts which are necessary for disposal of this appeal are that the writ petitioners- appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court of Jharkhand seeking a writ of mandamus against respondent Nos.3 to 6 to release and pay D.A. with arrears along with interest and further a direction was sought to be issued to respondent Nos.3 to 6 not to close the school or in the alternative a direction was sought to be issued to respondent Nos.1 & 2 to take over the management and control of the school in question. All the writ petitioners claimed themselves as teachers and non-teaching staff of the School and claimed themselves to be the employees of the Hindustan Copper Limited (hereinafter to be referred to as HCL). It was alleged that in the year 1933 Indian Copper Corporation, a private sector unit, registered in the United Kingdom started a Lower Primary School at Moubhander for the children of its employees which was named as Moubhander Lower Primary School. In the year 1944-45, the school was upgraded to Upper Primary School i.e. upto Class V. In 1958-59 the School was upgraded to a Middle School and recognition to Middle School was accorded by the then District Superintendent of Education, Chaibasa. Thereafter on",
        "5. 1972 the Indian Copper Corporation (Acquisition of Undertaking) Act, 1972 was notified and the Indian Copper Corporation was taken over by the Central Government and it became a part of HCL, a Government of India enterprise. It was alleged that thereafter the School was sought to be taken over by the State Government but this was resisted by the Managing Committee of the School. It was alleged that the management of HCL was running two schools, one at Mosabani and another at Moubhander as proprietary schools and they were managed by the Managing Committee. The present school was getting the financial assistance from the management of the HCL. The Bihar Non-Government Secondary Schools (Taking over of Management and Control) Act, 1981 (hereinafter to be referred to as the Act ) was passed. Section 19 of the Act laid down certain conditions for grant of recognition to such proprietary schools run through the Managing Committee and therefore, it was contended that the school was run by the Managing Committee and the service conditions of staff of the school were approved by the Executive Director and thereafter request was made by the HCL to the Education Commission for grant of recognition as a High School. The school was recognized by the State Government under the provisions of the Act of",
        "6. It was alleged that the Managing Committee of the School was constituted and reconstituted by the Management of the HCL. Thereafter 10+ 2 stream was introduced in the said School and a request was made by the President of the School to the Director, Bihar Secondary Education seeking permission to upgrade the ICC High School, Moubhander to +2 stage and the same was recognized by the Government of Bihar. However, in the meanwhile because of critical financial situation the managing committee of the school requested the management of the HCL to approach the State Government for taking over of the school at the earliest. The school was not taken over under the Act of 1981 by the newly formed State of Jharkhand. Since the management of HCL was closed on account of financial stress, therefore, no financial aid could be extended to the school and the writ petitioners could not get their salaries as the financial aid was not coming from the management of the HCL and therefore, they approached the High Court of Jharkhand for issuance of writ of mandamus against respondent nos. 3 to 6 to release pay and arrears along with dearness allowance and they also sought a further direction not to close down the school and in the alternative a direction was also sought to be issued against respondent nos. 1 & 2 to take over the management of the school.",
        "7. A reply was filed by the Management of HCL. It took the stand that there was no relationship of employer and employee between the management of HCL and the school and it was stated that the company was merely providing grant for imparting education and the school was run by the Managing Committee. It was also contended that the school was not the liability of the management of the HCL. The school was being managed by the Managing Committee and only financial aid was provided by the management of HCL from time to time but since the management of HCL was in financial doldrums it was unable to manage the school. However, it was categorically stated that there was no relationship of employer and employee between the management of HCL and the staff of the school.",
        "8. Learned Single Judge after considering the matter in number of petitions, came to the conclusion that the school was not the dominant object of the HCL and it found that there was no relationship of employer and employee between the Management of HCL and the teachers and other staff of the School. Therefore, no direction was given and the writ petition was dismissed by the learned Single Judge relying on the aforesaid judgment in the case of Chatradhar Mahto & Ors. V. State of Jharkhand & Ors.. Hence the writ petitioner- appellants approached this Court by filing the special leave petition against the order of learned Single Judge dated",
        "9. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records. The basic question before us is whether a writ of mandamus could be issued against the management of HCL. Learned Single Judge relying on the Division Bench in an identical matter pertaining to Bharat Coking Coal Limited dismissed the writ petition of the appellants. This issue was examined in an analogous writ petition and in the aforesaid case, this issue was extensively considered as to whether the management of the school is the direct responsibility of the HCL or not. After considering the matter in detail, learned Single Judge relying on the aforesaid judgment found that there is no relationship of master and servant with that of the teachers and other staff of the school with the HCL as the management of the school was done by the Managing Committee through liberal financial grant was being made by the Corporation. By that there was no direct connection of the management of the HCL with that of the management of the school. Though through various communication an impression was sought to be given that the school is being run by the HCL but in substance the HCL only used to provide financial assistance to the school but the management of the school was entirely different than the management of the HCL. Giving financial assistance does not necessarily mean that all the teachers and staff who are working in the school have become the employees of the HCL. Therefore, we are of the view that the view taken by learned Single Judge appears to be correct that there was no relationship of the management of the HCL with that of the management of the school though most of the employees of the HCL were in the managing committee of the school. But by that no inference can be drawn that the school had been established by the HCL. The children of workers of HCL were being benefited by the education imparted by this school. Therefore, the management of HCL was giving financial aid but by that it cannot be construed that the school was run by the management of HCL. Therefore, under these circumstances, we are of opinion that the view taken by the learned Single Judge appears to be correct.",
        "10. Next, it was contended that even if the school is not a part of the management of the HCL, yet a direction could be given to the State of Jharkhand under the Act of 1981 to take over the management of the school and in that connection our attention was invited to the definition of proprietary school as defined in Section 2(d) of the Act which reads as under: (d) Proprietary secondary school means such secondary school whose entire financial liability is borne out by (any Registered Trust, Association or corporate body, individuals or a group of individuals) and which according to such conditions and registrations laid down from time to time by the State Government, may be declared by it proprietary secondary school. Section 3 laid down taking over control and management of non-government secondary schools by State Government. Section 19 laid down that proprietary secondary school can be established. Section 19 only says that if any registered Trust (Association, Corporate Body, individual or group of individuals) applies for setting up a secondary school and promises in writing to bear the entire financial burden of the school, the State Government shall have the power to permit establishment of such school after fulfillment of the prescribed conditions for recognition under section",
        "11. By this it does not mean that writ of mandamus can be issued to the State Government for taking over the management of the school. The proprietary secondary school is defined under Section 2(d) of the Act. The State Government can declare a particular school as proprietary secondary school under Section 19 of the Act on fulfilling certain conditions but the basic thing is that the entire finance will have to be burdened by the Trust, Association, Corporate Body, individual or group of individuals. By that the employees of the school will not be State Government employees. A counter affidavit was filed on behalf of the State of Jharkhand supported by the affidavit of Shri Rajendra Nath Tripathy, Regional Deputy Director of Education, South Chhota Nagpur Division, Ranchi and in paragraph 12 of the counter affidavit it was pointed out that in order to fulfill the constitutional mandate that all children between 6 -14 years of age shall be given free and compulsory education, the Jharkhand Government has given consent and directed the concerned authorities to take the students of this school and admit them in State Committee managed schools or in other Government schools within the same area in equivalent classes in which they were studying. Copy of the letter dated",
        "12. 2003 has been annexed as Annexure-R-",
        "13. Therefore, the Government of Jharkhand in order to fulfill the constitutional mandate has got these students admitted to various schools. Therefore, the studies of the students have not been affected. So far as issuance of mandamus to the State Government for taking over of the proprietary school is concerned, that cannot be issued because the proprietary school as defined under section 2(d) read with Section 19 of the Act will have to make a request to the State of Jharkhand that they will bear all the financial responsibilities. If the Managing Committee makes a request to this effect to the State of Jharkhand, then the Government may consider but at present there is no such offer by the Managing Committee and as such no direction can be given to the State of Jharkhand to grant recognition to proprietary school because nobody is prepared to take the financial responsibilities of the management of the school. Hence, no direction can be issued to the State Government to take over the management of the School.",
        "14. In this view of the matter, we"
