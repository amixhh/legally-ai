        "36. I respectfully submit that being the best enquiry and steps taken by all the Courts my properties were recovered.

If the failure party will proceed further appeal till before this Honble Court it will take another 6 years to complete. Due to the appeal case pending, I could not get any remedy in time and I am not in a position to continue the studies or marriage of my daughters and their future will be in question.",
        "37. Further I respectfully submit that, the Petitioners No. 1 and No. 2 are also suffered much by way of losing business, mental agony and the Petitioner No. 1 is also aged about 83 years and suffers with Hypertension, Sugar, B.P. Heart Attack etc., and further he will not live without taking insulin as per the advice of the doctor and that he is taking treatment for the last so many years in hospital and now also the doctor advised to take bed rest by taking continuous treatment, he got major Heart Operation at Hyderabad and Bombay.",
        "38. Considering all these facts, both the Petitioners No. 1 and No. 2 and myself have agreed to enter compromise to compound the offences as per the terms of the affidavit filed before this Honble Court.",
        "39. I respectfully submit that, I have no grievance with Petitioners No. 1 and No. 2, since all of the disputes were amicably settled by Petitioners No. 1 and No. 2 with me.\"",
        "40. We may at the outset note that the offences under Sections 384 and 506 Part-II IPC are not compoundable under Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,",
        "41. Therefore, the prayer of compounding the offences made by the complainant and A-1 in their joint application supported by their affidavits cannot be legally accepted by us.",
        "42. We have heard Mr. Uday U. Lalit, Senior Advocate for A-1 and Mr. R. Sundaravardhan, Senior Advocate for respondent - State, and with their assistance we have gone through the judgment of the learned IV Additional Sessions Judge as confirmed by the High Court and also the evidence led by the prosecution. Mr. Uday U. Lalit, learned Senior Advocate contended that the courts below have recorded their findings against the appellant on conjectures and surmises, on the basis of misreading of the evidence led on record by the complainant. The complainant has failed to prove the ingredients constituting the offences under Sections 384 and 506 Part-II of IPC and, therefore, the impugned judgment of the High Court does not stand judicial scrutiny. He next contended that the complainant has not established on record that A-1 had any intention to put the complainant under any threat, fear or injury or in any manner dishonestly induced him to deliver the ownership and possession of the property or valuable security to A-",
        "43. He also contended that the trial court, appellate court and the High Court all have erred in placing reliance on the highly interested and discrepant testimony of witnesses who have given one sided version, whereas the version of A-1 has not been properly appreciated and considered. It was lastly contended that the complainant has not explained the delay of about three years in lodging the FIR against the accused persons.",
        "44. As against that, Mr. R. Sundaravardhan, Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of State, has canvassed for the correctness of the view taken by trial judge, as also by the appellate court which was confirmed by the High Court.",
        "45. In order to appreciate the aforesaid rival contentions of the learned counsel for the parties, on our examination of the judgment given by the trial court, as also by the appellate court and confirmed by the High Court, we find that all the courts have properly and rightly appreciated the entire evidence on record and there is no infirmity or perversity in the findings recorded by the courts below to interfere with the well-thought and well-reasoned judgments. The evidence led by the complainant has satisfactorily and convincingly proved the charges levelled against A-1 and A-2 beyond reasonable doubt. The three courts have concurrently held both the accused guilty of the crime and we do not find any good reason to differ with the view taken by the courts below. Thus, the conviction of A-1 under Sections 384 and 506 Part-II IPC cannot be found faulty on any ground. Now, the only question that survives for our consideration is in regard to the quantum of sentence.",
        "46. A-1 is now about 83 years old. He is suffering from hypertension, sugar, high blood pressure, heart attack etc. He is said to be regularly taking insulin and the doctor has advised him to take complete bed rest and continue to take proper medical treatment without fail. The compromise agreement reveals that A-1 has undergone heart operations at Hyderabad and Bombay. A-1 has returned the property, the subject-matter of the dispute to the complainant and has also paid the amount of compensation of Rs. 50,000/- in terms of the order of the High Court. On consideration of the contents of the above-said compromise agreement and in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that instead of sentencing A-1 to undergo the substantive sentence of imprisonment as imposed upon him by the High Court, the interest of justice would be sub-served if the amount of fine of Rs. 1,000/- imposed upon A-1 under Section 384 IPC is enhanced to Rs. 3,000/- and the amount of fine of Rs. 500/- is enhanced to Rs. 2,000/- for offence under Section 506 IPC. Thus, the judgment and order of the High Court would stand modified to that extent."
