It provides that the Excise Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner may issue an F.L. – 1 License for the sale of Indian liquor or foreign liquor, or both, in accordance with the provisions of Section 14 (2) of the Excise Act.",
        "58. Chapter XIII of the Excise Rules contains the General Conditions of Excise Licenses. Rule 188 states that Chapter XIII will apply to all Licenses issued under the Excise Act for sale of liquors, and every license is deemed to include the conditions prescribed herein. Rule 189 of the Excise Rules describes ?shop? as the licensed premises from where liquor is sold. Rule 191 (2) provides that the applicant of a license shall select a site, and intimate the licensing authority, who may, after making such enquiry as he thinks fit, approve the site selected. Rule 191 (4) provides that the Licensee shall sell the liquor only from the approved shop.",
        "59. The Appellant is the holder of an F.L. – 1 License issued by the Licensing Authority viz. the Deputy Commissioner, Excise, Mahe for carrying out vending of IMFL. An F.L.¬1 Licensee is permitted to sell liquor only to other Licensees, and not in retail.",
        "60. The Petitioner was carrying out his wholesale business from MMC, No. 1/40,41 Main Road, Mahe.",
        "61. The Appellant filed an Application dated",
        "62. 2017 for shifting his liquor shop from Mahe to Karaikal under Rules 163 and 209 of the Excise Rules before the Deputy Commissioner, (Excise), Mahe.",
        "63. Rule 209 in Chapter XIII of the Excise Rules provides for Shifting of Shops of all license holders, whether wholesale or retail. Rule 209 permits shifting of the liquor shop from one ?place? to another, subject to approval by the Licensing Authority on the terms and conditions contained therein. The proviso to Rule 209 states that the Licensing Authority may permit shifting of the licensed premises, subject to the fulfillment of the conditions of license, and payment of 1/4 th of the license fee for such shifting. There is no restriction or prohibition either in the Excise Act or Rules on the Licensing Authority from granting permission to shift the licensed shop from one region to another, subject to the conditions being complied with. A fortiori, a licensee can shift a liquor shop from one region to another within the Union Territory of Puducherry, subject to the prior approval of the Competent Authority.",
        "64. We are of the view that the expression ‘from one place to another? is not restrictive, and does not curtail the power of the Licensing Authority to grant permission for shifting the licensed shop from one region to another in the Union Territory of Puducherry so long as the conditions stipulated by the Excise Act and Excise Rules, as also the conditions for grant of a license are complied with. The shifting should not result in the increase in number of liquor shops beyond the maximum number of licenses which may be fixed for a particular area under Rule 122 of the Excise Rules.",
        "65. Given the peculiar demography of the Union Territory of Puducherry, which comprises of four unconnected regions, it would be contrary to the object and purpose of the Excise Act, if a restrictive meaning was to be given to Rule 209 of the Excise Rules. The Act must be read as a whole to ascertain the intent of the legislature. If the intention of the legislature was to restrict the shifting of a liquor shop to a region, locality, municipality, or commune, Rule 209 of the Excise Act would have expressly contained such a prohibition, which is absent.",
        "66. The Excise Act and the Excise Rules use the expression ‘local area? in contra-distinction with the word ‘place?, whenever it is intended to confine the area in which the liquor shop is located. For instance, Section 9 of the Excise Act prohibits the transportation of intoxicants from one ‘local area? to another. Similarly, Section 10 of the Excise Act restricts the movement of intoxicants beyond a certain quantity which is stipulated for a ‘local area?.",
        "67. We find from the Counter Affidavit filed by the State that similar proposals for shifting 5 shops to Karaikal from other regions were granted by the Licensing Authority, as per details given hereinbelow : TABLE",
        "68. The Counsel for the State submitted that Respondent Nos. 2 to 4 – Excise Authorities have assessed the pros and cons of the shifting, and sought the view of the police authorities prior to granting permission to the Appellant. The Report of the Excise Officer was obtained, which stated that the site of the Appellant at Karaikal is not located on the National or State Highway. There are no religious or educational institutions which are located within the 100 meters radius of the site at Karaikal. There would be no hindrance to the traffic in the area. The Superintendent of Police confirmed that there would be no law and order problem if the licensed shop of the Appellant is shifted.",
        "69. In the present case, the Licensing Authority i.e. the Deputy Commissioner (Excise) vide Letter dated",
        "70. 2018 has granted permission to shift the F.L.1 Licensed premises of the Appellant from Mahe to Karaikal, subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in Rule 209 of the Excise Rules. The Deputy Commissioner (Excise), Mahe permitted shifting of the premises subject to two additional conditions viz. (i) There shall be one and the same entrance and exit only; (ii) The boundary of the building should be properly protected.We have been informed by the Counsel for the Appellant and the State that all conditions under the Excise Act and Rules have complied with.",
        "71. Consequently, Respondent No. 3 ¬ the Deputy Commissioner (Excise), Karaikal vide letter dated",
        "72. 2018 granted permission to the Appellant to run the F.L.-1 business from the location designated in Karaikal.",

        "74. 2018 for shifting the licensed shop from Mahe to Karaikal granted by Respondent No. 3 is legal and valid."
