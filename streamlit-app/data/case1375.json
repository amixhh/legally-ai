        "6. 2014 and",
        "7. 2015 made by the appellant-wife. In the enquiry, the respondent-husband was exonerated.",

        "13. 2 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree passed by the learned Family Court dissolving the marriage between the appellant and the respondent, the appellant herein preferred an appeal before the High Court being D.B. Civil Miscellaneous Appeal No. 2845/",
        "14. By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has dismissed the said appeal and has confirmed the judgment and decree passed by the learned family Court. Hence, the present appeal is at the instance of the appellant-wife.",
        "15. We have heard Ms. Neela Gokhale, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant. It is very unfortunate that though served, the respondent-husband has not appeared in the present appeal and it is reported that despite the order of status quo passed by this Court vide interim order dated",
        "16. 2019, the respondent-husband has re-married.",
        "17. 1 Number of submissions have been made by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant-wife on the findings recorded by the learned Family Court as well as the High Court on cruelty and desertion by the appellant-wife. It is also the case on behalf of the appellant-wife that subsequently and despite the order of status quo passed by this Court on",
        "18. 2019, the respondent-husband has re-married and that is why he is not appearing in the present proceedings.",
        "19. 2 It is urged on behalf of the appellant-wife that in the alternative, the findings against the appellant-wife on cruelty may be expunged and marriage may be continued to remain dissolved on account of irretrievable breakdown of marriage since both wife and husband are residing separately since May, 2011 and the respondent-husband has already re-married. However, it is submitted to direct the respondenthusband to pay maintenance to the appellant-wife and minor son – Pranav as they have no means of maintaining themselves and have no independent income to sustain themselves.",

        "22. It is therefore prayed to direct the respondenthusband to pay the maintenance to the appellant and her minor son.",
        "23. Having heard learned counsel for the appellant-wife and having gone through the findings recorded by the learned Family Court as well as by the High Court, on cruelty and desertion by the appellant-wife, we are of the view that there are concurrent findings recorded by the learned Family Court as well as the High Court on cruelty and desertion by the appellant-wife, which as such are on appreciation of evidence on record. The appellant-wife made number of complaints against the respondent-husband to his employer – Army Authorities making serious allegations of extra-marital affairs. On the basis of the complaints made by the appellant-wife, an enquiry was initiated by the Army Authorities and the Army Authorities exonerated the respondenthusband of the allegation of extra-marital affairs.",
        "24. However, considering the fact that both, the appellant-wife and the respondent-husband are not staying together since May, 2011 and therefore it can be said that there is irretrievable breakdown of marriage between them. It is also reported that the respondent-husband has already re-married. Therefore, no useful purpose shall be served to further enter into the merits of the findings recorded by the courts below on cruelty and desertion by the appellant-wife. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case and in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, the decree passed by the learned Family Court, confirmed by the High Court, dissolving the marriage between the appellant-wife and the respondent-husband is not required to be interfered with on account of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. However, at the same time, the respondent-husband cannot be absolved from his liability and responsibility to maintain his son Pranav till he attains the age of majority. Whatever be the dispute between the husband and the wife, a child should not be made to suffer. The liability and responsibility of the father to maintain the child continues till the child/son attains the age of majority. It also cannot be disputed that the son Pranav has a right to be maintained as per the status of his father. It is reported that the mother is not earning anything. She is residing at her parental house at Jaipur. Therefore, a reasonable/sufficient amount is required for the maintenance of her son including his education etc. which shall have to be paid by the respondent-husband, irrespective of the decree of dissolution of marriage between the appellant-wife and the respondent-husband. The amount which was being paid pursuant to the order passed by the Army Authorities on",
        "25. 2012 has also been stopped by the respondent-husband since December,"
