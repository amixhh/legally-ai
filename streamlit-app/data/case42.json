        "51. It is submitted that the respondent No.1 after submitting first application on",
        "52. 2016 for in country adoption having acquired US citizenship on",
        "53. 2016 went outside the zone of in country adoption. It is submitted that the second application was submitted by the respondents on",
        "54. 2017 for inter country adoption but in that second application, the respondents have given their different identity and mobile numbers. It is submitted that the respondent having gone out of zone of consideration for in country adoption, their application cannot be directed to be considered on the basis of seniority for in country adoption. It is submitted that there are more than 22,000 parents waiting, according to seniority, for in country adoption, respondents cannot stroll march over them.

        "59.

It is submitted that as per Regulation 41 of the Regulations, 2017, a common seniority list is contemplated, which means that respondents shall retain their seniority position on the basis of first application. Thus, offer to adopt Shomya to the respondents cannot be faulted. It is submitted that respondent Nos.1 and 2 being fully competent for applying for adoption, who are still qualified and economically stable and eager to adopt the child cannot be denied their right merely because the respondent No.1 was conferred the US citizenship on",

It is submitted that the High Court has rightly held that present case can be considered as an exceptional case and without making it a precedent, the adoption in favour of the respondents be allowed to maintain.",
        "65. We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the records.",
        "66. The 2015 Act, Chapter VIII deals with adoption. Section 56 sub-section (1) provides that adoption shall be resorted to for ensuring right to family for the orphan, abandoned and surrendered children, as per the provisions of the Act, the rules made thereunder and the adoption regulations framed by the authority. Section 57 deals with eligibility of prospective adoptive parents, which is as follows:-",
        "67. Eligibility of prospective adoptive parents.-- (1) The prospective adoptive parents shall be physically fit, financially sound, mentally alert and highly motivated to adopt a child for providing a good upbringing to him. (2) In case of a couple, the consent of both the spouses for the adoption shall be required. (3) A single or divorced person can also adopt, subject to fulfilment of the criteria and in accordance with the provisions of adoption regulations framed by the Authority. (4) A single male is not eligible to adopt a girl child. (5) Any other criteria that may be specified in the adoption regulations framed by the Authority",
        "68. Section 58 deals with procedure for adoption by Indian prospective adoptive parents living in India, which is to the following effect:-",
        "69. Procedure for adoption by Indian prospective adoptive parents living in India.-- (1) Indian prospective adoptive parents living in India, irrespective of their religion, if interested to adopt an orphan or abandoned or surrendered child, may apply for the same to a Specialised Adoption Agency, in the manner as provided in the adoption regulations framed by the Authority.

(5) The progress and well-being of the child in the adoptive family shall be followed up and ascertained in the manner as provided in the adoption regulations framed by the Authority.",
        "70. The next provision, which needs to be noticed is Section 59, which provides for procedure for inter- country adoption of an orphan or abandoned or surrendered child, which is as follows:-",
        "71. Procedure for inter-country adoption of an orphan or abandoned or surrendered child.-- (1) If an orphan or abandoned or surrendered child could not be placed with an Indian or non-resident Indian prospective adoptive parent despite the joint effort of the Specialised Adoption Agency and State Agency within sixty days from the date the child has been declared legally free for adoption, such child shall be free for inter-country adoption: Provided that children with physical and mental disability, siblings and children above five years of age may be given preference over other children for such inter-country adoption, in accordance with the adoption regulations, as may be framed by the Authority. (2) An eligible non-resident Indian or overseas citizen of India or persons of Indian origin shall be given priority in inter-country adoption of Indian children. (3) A non-resident Indian or overseas citizen of India, or person of Indian origin or a foreigner, who are prospective adoptive parents living abroad, irrespective of their religion, if interested to adopt an orphan or abandoned or surrendered child from India, may apply for the same to an authorised foreign adoption agency, or Central Authority or a concerned Government department in their country of habitual residence, as the case may be, in the manner as provided in the adoption regulations framed by the Authority. (4) The authorised foreign adoption agency, or Central Authority, or a concerned Government department, as the case may be, shall prepare the home study report of such prospective adoptive parents and upon finding them eligible, will sponsor their application to Authority for adoption of a child from India, in the manner as provided in the adoption regulations framed by the Authority. (5) On the receipt of the application of such prospective adoptive parents, the Authority shall examine and if it finds the applicants suitable, then, it will refer the application to one of the Specialised Adoption Agencies, where children legally free for adoption are available. (6) The Specialised Adoption Agency will match a child with such prospective adoptive parents and send the child study report and medical report of the child to such parents, who in turn may accept the child and return the child study and medical report duly signed by them to the said agency. (7) On receipt of the acceptance of the child from the prospective adoptive parents, the Specialised Adoption Agency shall file an application in the court for obtaining the adoption order, in the manner as provided in the adoption regulations framed by the Authority. (8) On the receipt of a certified copy of the court order, the specialised adoption agency shall send immediately the same to Authority, State Agency and to the prospective adoptive parents, and obtain a passport for the child. (9) The Authority shall intimate about the adoption to the immigration authorities of India and the receiving country of the child. (10) The prospective adoptive parents shall receive the child in person from the specialised adoption agency as soon as the passport and visa are issued to the child. (11) The authorised foreign adoption agency, or Central Authority, or the concerned Government department, as the case may be, shall ensure the submission of progress reports about the child in the adoptive family and will be responsible for making alternative arrangement in the case of any disruption, in consultation with Authority and concerned Indian diplomatic mission, in the manner as provided in the adoption regulations framed by the Authority. (12) A foreigner or a person of Indian origin or an overseas citizen of India, who has habitual residence in India, if interested to adopt a child from India, may apply to Authority for the same along with a no objection certificate from the diplomatic mission of his country in India, for further necessary actions as provided in the adoption regulations framed by the Authority",
        "72. The respondent Nos.1 and 2 submitted their application as prospective adoptive parents living in India. Although, on the date of submission of application, respondent No.2 was already a US citizen, the respondent No.1 being Indian citizen, the application was fully maintainable as per the provisions of Regulations and as per the guidelines applicable at the relevant time as Indian prospective adoptive parents. Even Regulation 21(1) of Regulations, 2017 provides that if one of the prospective adoptive parents is foreigner and other is an Indian, such case shall be treated at par with Indians living in India. After the respondent No.1 acquired the US citizenship on",
        "73. 2016 and OCI card was issued to respondent No.1 on",
        "74. 2017, second application was submitted on",
        "75. 2017 by the respondents for inter-country adoption both having become US citizens. In view of the fact that both had become US citizens by",
        "76. 2016, they were not eligible for adoption as Indian prospective adoptive parents living in India. Mere fact that Act or Regulations does not provide for any mechanism to upload any further information in first registration cannot alter the legal position and consequences of acquiring the foreign citizenship by an Indian. The consequences of obtaining US citizenship of respondent Nos.1 and 2 shall take its effect immediately.",
        "77. The submission of learned counsel for the respondents that Regulation 41 deals with common seniority list also need to be noted. Regulation 41 of the Regulations, 2017 is as follows:-",
        "78. Seniority of the prospective adoptive parents.- (1) The prospective adoptive parents shall be referred children on the basis of a single seniority list, which shall be maintained from the date of registration and other criteria as stipulated under these regulations. (2) The seniority of resident Indians shall be based on the date of online registration and submission of the documents, except for Home Study Report, in Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System. (3) The seniority of Non Resident Indian or Overseas Citizen of India or foreign prospective adoptive parents shall be based on the date of online registration and submission of the requisite documents alongwith Home Study Report in Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System. (4) Prospective adoptive parents shall be allowed to change the State preference once within sixty days from the date of registration and in case they change the State preference after sixty days from the date of registration, they shall be placed at the bottom of the seniority list in the changed State. (5) Seniority of prospective adoptive parents registered as single, but married later shall be counted from the date of registration as single after receipt of fresh Home Study Report. (6) Prospective adoptive parents registered for normal child, shall be able to adopt a special need child or hard to place child with the same registration.",
        "79. It is also submitted that prior to Regulations, 2017, there were two separate seniority lists, which were maintained under the Guidelines, 2015, which has been now made a single seniority list. Even if there is a single seniority list, now contemplated by Regulation 41, a placement in the seniority list with regard to resident Indian and non-resident Indian or overseas citizen of India are based on different yardsticks as provided in Regulations 41(2) and 41(3). Even if the common seniority list has to be utilised for the purpose of in country adoption and inter-country adoption as per the respective categories, the difference between in country adoption and inter-country adoption cannot be lost sight or given a go bye by the mere fact that a common seniority list is maintained. It is true that Regulation 41 or any other Regulation does not contemplate a situation when a resident Indian after acquiring the foreign citizenship submits a fresh registration, what is the consequence and value of its first registration. Even though regulations are silent and do not provide for any mechanism or any answer to such fact situation, the natural consequences of acquiring foreign citizenship shall follow. We, thus, find force in the submission of the learned ASG that the right of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for adoption as resident Indian is lost after respondent No.1 having acquired the US citizenship on",
        "80. Offer of the child to the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 was based on their first application dated",
        "81. 2016, in which if the clause of foreign citizenship is ignored, was in accordance with the Act and the Rules. Further, whether the factum of respondent No.1 acquiring US citizenship on",
        "82. 2016 should be ignored for the purposes of adoption or not is the question, which is required to be addressed and answered in these appeals.",
        "83. Section 58 and 59 provides for two different mechanisms for adoption. As per Section 59(1), if an orphan or abandoned or surrendered child could not be placed with an Indian or non-resident Indian prospective adoptive parents despite the joint effort of the Specialised Adoption Agency and State Agency within sixty days from the date the child has been declared legally free for adoption, such child shall be free for inter-country adoption. Thus, sixty days period has to be elapsed from the date when the child has been declared legally free for adoption. In the present case, child was declared free for adoption on",
        "84. 2017 by Child Welfare Committee, Patna, Bihar. Before expiry of sixty days, child could not have been offered for adoption to parents, who are eligible for adoption under Section",
        "85. We are, however, not oblivious to the fact that respondent Nos.1 and 2 had been bonafide pursuing their applications for adoption, initially as resident Indians and thereafter even as overseas citizens of India. As per Section 57, both the respondent Nos.1 and 2 are fully eligible and competent to adopt the child. It was under the circumstances as noticed above that the child Shomya was offered to respondent Nos.1 and 2, who rightly communicated their acceptance and communicated with the child and are willing to take child in adoption and to take all care and provide good education to her. We have no doubt in the bonafide or the competence of respondent Nos.1 and 2 in their effort to take the child in adoption, but the statutory procedure and the statutory regime, which is prevalent as on date and is equally applicable to all aspirants, i.e., Indian prospective adoptive parents and prospective adoptive parents for inter-country adoption, cannot be lost sight. However, by virtue of Section 59(2), the respondent Nos.1 and 2 can at best may be given priority in inter-country adoption, they being eligible overseas citizens of India and further due to consequences of events and facts as noticed above."
