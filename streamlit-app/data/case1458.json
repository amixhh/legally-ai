        "213. A writ of mandamus was prayed for to pay a sum of Rs.31,57,16,134/- with 18% interest. In reply to the said writ petition, the assertions made by the writ petitioner were controverted but also an objection was raised that there was a clause for arbitration for resolving disputes arising between the parties, therefore, the writ petitioner should have approached the designated authority by appointment of an arbitrator.",
        "214. The appellants in their affidavit had pointed out that after comple- tion of the formation work, the writ petitioner had communicated expenses of Rs.16,93,51,980/- as against provision of Rs.16,26,71,",
        "215. It was asserted that the writ petitioner has been paid a sum of Rs.",

        "219. 2013 has been issued by the Headquarters, Border Road Task Force stating that the mini- mum distance was to be measured from center line of carriage way and not from the edge of the roadway. Thus, the entire claim was based upon imaginary and arbitrary grounds which was enhanced from time to time.",
        "220. Mr. Nataraj, learned ASG appearing for the appellants, pointed out that there are serious disputes about the facts in respect of authenticity of the Joint Final Report and the work done. Therefore, such disputed question of facts could not have been adjudicated by the Writ Court as disputed question of facts relating to recovery of money could not have been entertained thereunder. Reliance has been placed upon the judgment of this Court reported as Kerala State Electricity Board & Anr. v. Kurien E. Kalathil & Ors. (2000) 6 SCC 293 wherein it was held as under:",
        "221. We find that there is a merit in the first contention of Mr Raval. Learned counsel has rightly questioned the maintainability of the writ petition. The interpretation and implementation of a clause in a contract cannot be the subject-matter of a writ petition. Whether the contract envisages actual payment or not is a question of construction of contract. If a term of a contract is violated, ordinarily the remedy is not the writ petition under Article",
        "222. We are also unable to agree with the observations of the High Court that the contractor was seeking enforcement of a statutory contract. A contract would not become statutory simply because it is for construction of a public utility and it has been awarded by a statutory body. We are also unable to agree with the observation of the High Court that since the obligations imposed by the contract on the contracting parties come within the purview of the Contract Act, that would not make the contract statutory. Clearly, the High Court fell into an error in coming to the conclusion that the contract in question was statutory in nature.",
        "223. A statute may expressly or impliedly confer power on a statutory body to enter into contracts in order to enable it to discharge its functions. Dispute arising out of the terms of such contracts or alleged breaches have to be settled by the ordinary principles of law of contract. The fact that one of the parties to the agreement is a statutory or public body will not by itself affect the principles to be applied. The disputes about the meaning of a covenant in a contract or its enforceability have to be determined according to the usual principles of the Contract Act. Every act of a statutory body need not necessarily involve an exercise of statutory power. Statutory bodies, like private parties, have power to contract or deal with property. Such activities may not raise any issue of public law. In the present case, it has not been shown how the contract is statutory. The contract between the parties is in the realm of private law. It is not a statutory contract. The disputes relating to interpretation of the terms and conditions of such a contract could not have been agitated in a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. That is a matter for adjudication by a civil court or in arbitration if provided for in the contract. Whether any amount is due and if so, how much and refusal of the appellant to pay it is justified or not, are not the matters which could have been agitated and decided in a writ petition. The contractor should have relegated to other remedies.",
        "224. Mr. Nataraj also placed reliance on the judgment of this Court reported as Joshi Technologies International Inc v. Union of India & Ors. (2015) 7 SCC 728 wherein the following was held:",
        "225. Law in this aspect has developed through catena of judgments of this Court and from the reading of these judgments it would follow that in pure contractual matters the extraordinary remedy of writ under Article 226 or Article 32 of the Constitution cannot be invoked. However, in a limited sphere such remedies are available only when the non-Government contracting party is able to demonstrate that it is a public law remedy which such party seeks to invoke, in contradistinction to the private law remedy simpliciter under the contract. Some of the case law to bring home this cardinal principle is taken note of hereinafter. xx xx xx",
        "226. On the basis of these facts, this Court observed that the aforesaid observations of the High Court relying upon Ramana Dayaram Shetty case [(1979) 3 SCC 489 : (1979) 2 LLJ 217 ] were not correct. Thus observed the Court, speaking through Ratnavel Pandian, J.: (Ajai Pal Singh case [(1989) 2 SCC 116 : (1989) 1 SCR 743 ] , SCC pp. 125-26, paras 21-22)",
        "227. This finding in our view, is not correct in the light of the facts and circumstances of this case because in Ramana Dayaram Shetty case [(1979) 3 SCC 489 : (1979) 2 LLJ 217 ] there was no concluded contract as in this case. Even conceding that the BDA has the trappings of a State or would be comprehended in other authority for the purpose of Article 12 of the Constitution, while determining price of the houses/flats constructed by it and the rate of monthly instalments to be paid, the authority or its agent after entering into the field of ordinary contract acts purely in its executive capacity. Thereafter the relations are no longer governed by the constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which determines the rights and obligations of the parties inter se. In this sphere, they can only claim rights conferred upon them by the contract in the absence of any statutory obligations on the part of the authority (i.e. BDA in this case) in the said contractual field.",
        "228. There is a line of decisions where the contract entered into between the State and the persons aggrieved is non-statutory and purely contractual and the rights are governed only by the terms of the contract, no writ or order can be issued under Article 226 of the Constitution of India so as to compel the authorities to remedy a breach of contract pure and simple — Radhakrishna Agarwal v. State of Bihar [(1977) 3 SCC 457] , Premji Bhai Parmar v. DDA [(1980) 2 SCC 129] and Divl. Forest Officer v. Bishwanath Tea Co. Ltd. [(1981) 3 SCC 238 : (1981) 3 SCR 662 ] xx xx xx",
        "229. The position thus summarised in the aforesaid principles has to be understood in the context of discussion that preceded which we have pointed out above. As per this, no doubt, there is no absolute bar to the maintainability of the writ petition even in contractual matters or where there are disputed questions of fact or even when monetary claim is raised. At the same time, discretion lies with the High Court which under certain circumstances, it can refuse to exercise. It also follows that under the following circumstances, normally, the Court would not exercise such a discretion:",
        "230. The Court may not examine the issue unless the action has some public law character attached to it.",
        "231. Whenever a particular mode of settlement of dispute is provided in the contract, the High Court would refuse to exercise its discretion under Article 226 of the Constitution and relegate the party to the said mode of settlement, particularly when settlement of disputes is to be resorted to through the means of arbitration.",
        "232. If there are very serious disputed questions of fact which are of complex nature and require oral evidence for their determination.",
        "233. Money claims per se particularly arising out of contractual obligations are normally not to be entertained except in exceptional circumstances.",
        "234. It was thus argued that in view of the arbitration clause available to resolve the disputes, the order of the High Court was unwarranted and untenable. It was also argued that the High Court in the impugned order has held that resurvey was not possible as five monsoons have passed, therefore, the appellants were directed to approve the DPR and pay the pending bills on the basis of Final Joint Report.",
        "235. The letter dated",
        "236. 2015 was issued by the Chief Engineer, Project Vartak denying the allegations levelled by the writ petitioner and informing the writ petitioner that the Board of Officers is being cancelled at his request. It was also pointed out that the Board of Officers was constituted at the request of the writ petitioner to resolve the matter. The letter dated",
        "237. 2015 was in fact reply to the notice served by the petitioner under Section 80 of Code of Civil Procedure,",
        "238. Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned senior counsel for the writ petitioner, contended that the officer who had written such abovementioned letter was not the competent authority to write the same. Such argument was based upon an averment in the memorandum of appeal. The memorandum of appeal was signed by the panel counsel and was not supported by any affidavit of an officer of the appellant. We do not find any merit in the said argument raised. The letter itself stated that it has been approved by the Competent Authority. It appears that the decision was taken by the competent authority but the communication was issued by an officer on behalf of the competent authority. The basis of Joint Survey Report itself has been found to be fallacious. This Report appears to be a friendly act of some of the officers of the appellant, to grant benefit to the writ petitioner, though even not claimed by the petitioner at an early stage. The claim of Rs.23,68,11,",
        "239. 02 in the letter dated",
        "240. 2014 has swelled into an amount of Rs. 35,51,80,651 as per the notice under Section 80 of the Code. Therefore, for the purposes of these proceedings, the communication dated",
        "241. 2013 cannot be permitted to be disputed by the writ petitioner.",
        "242. The Board of Officers convened its meeting but the same was cancelled vide communication dated",
        "243. Thus, an attempt by the appellants to resolve the disputes regarding the measurements by constituting Board of Officers was scuttled by the writ petitioner for the reasons best known to him.",
        "244. The High Court has based its order on the ground that after five monsoons, the final measurements could not be ascertained. If the final measurements could not be done at the spot, the contemporary evidence and the measurement books prepared from time to time could be the basis for determining the liability of the appellants. The Joint Survey Report is not an admitted measurement, though some officers might have signed it. The Report prepared after the completion of work wherein no such work done is reflected in the measurement book prepared during execution of work is an attempt to inflate the claim raised by the writ petitioner. The entire amount claimed by the writ petitioner is disputed. It has been asserted that the entire payment due as against the claim of work order had been made, as reflected from the following table: I Awarded cost of the work under the Contract Rs.",
        "245. 87 Crores II Cost of the work already executed by the department on the same stretch before the award of work Rs.",
        "246. 86 Cr. III Cost of the work as reduced in view of prior departmental work Rs.",
        "247. 01 Crores IV Amended cost of work under the Contract Rs.",
        "248. 03 Crores V Contract cost in revised DPR processed to Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways Rs.",
        "249. 27 Crores VI Payment made to the contractor/respondent herein inclusive of Rs.",
        "250. 86 Crores as per the order dated",
        "251. 2017 of the Honble High Court Rs.",
        "252. 27 Crores VII Contractors claim as per final bill dated",
        "253. 2015 Rs.",
        "254. 76 Crores",
        "255. Therefore, the dispute could not be raised by way of a writ petition on the disputed questions of fact. Though, the jurisdiction of the High Court is wide but in respect of pure contractual matters in the field of private law, having no statutory flavour, are better adjudicated upon by the forum agreed to by the parties. The dispute as to whether the amount is payable or not and/or how much amount is payable are disputed questions of facts. There is no admission on the part of the appellants to infer that the amount stands crystallized. Therefore, in the absence of any acceptance of Joint Survey Report by the competent authority, no right would accrue to the writ petitioner only because measurements cannot be undertaken after passage of time. Maybe, the resurvey cannot take place but the measurement books of the work executed from time to time would form a reasonable basis for assessing the amount due and payable to the writ petitioner, but such process could be undertaken only by the agreed forum i.e., arbitration and not by the Writ Court as it does not have the expertise in respect of measurements or construction of roads.",
        "256. A perusal of the matter shows that collusion of some of the officers of the appellants with the contractor cannot be ruled out. Such collusion seems to be the basis of the writ petition filed before the High Court."
