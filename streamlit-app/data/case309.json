        "5. 2017 passed by the Single Judge of the said High Court in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.14368 of 2011, which arose out of the award dated",

        "10. The dispute in relation to the respondents dismissal was dealt with by the Industrial Tribunal at the instance of the respondent-employee with a view to decide its legality and correctness.",
        "11. It was then carried to the High Court in two rounds earlier which eventually led to passing of the impugned order by the Division Bench in an appeal filed by the appellant herein and now finally it is before this Court at the instance of the employer (Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation) against the dismissal of their appeal by the High Court.",
        "12. We heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the impugned order of the Division Bench.",
        "13. We are constrained to observe that on reading the impugned order, it is difficult to discern much less appreciate the factual and legal controversy in its proper perspective. The reasons are not far to seek.",
        "14. The impugned order has neither set out the facts properly nor the findings of the Tribunal clearly and Single Judge and nor dealt with any submissions urged by both the counsel and nor given its reasoning keeping in view the law laid down by this Court on the issues arising in the case to justify the dismissal of the appeal filed by the employer (appellant herein).",
        "15. In substance, we are not able to appreciate the slip short narration of the facts and unsubstantiated reasoning in support of the conclusion arrived at by the Division Bench.",
        "16. For these reasons, we do not wish to probe into the factual and legal issues arising in the case and instead allow the appeal, set aside the impugned order and remand the case to the Division Bench of the High Court for deciding the appeal afresh on merits keeping in view the aforementioned observations made by us."
