They had proceeded only on the basis of the first statement recorded.

        "24. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of the High Court, the Appellant-Revenue has filed this appeal before this Court.",
        "25. The Learned Counsel for the Appellant-Revenue submitted that the decision of this Court in Nizam Sugars (supra), has no application to the facts and circumstances of the instant case. Moreover, he contended that the permission of Commissioner for invoking the provisions of Section 11A of the Act, by the Joint Commissioner was not necessary. Thus he submitted that the judgment delivered by the High Court deserves to be quashed.",
        "26. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent-assessee supported the reasons given by the High Court. Moreover, he elucidated the application of the judgment of this Court in Nizam Sugars (supra), by stating that the Superintendent of Central Excise had visited the premises on",

        "28. 2000, which was barred by limitation as laid down in the above mentioned case.",
        "29. Upon hearing the counsel appearing for both sides and upon perusal of the judgment of the High Court and other orders passed by the authorities, we are of the view that the impugned judgment does not need any interference.",
        "30. We have carefully gone through the facts as ascertained by the Tribunal. Upon perusal of the order of the tribunal as well the judgment delivered by the High Court, it is not in dispute that alleged suppression of payment of duty by the respondent-company was brought to the notice of the authority on 25th October, 1996, when the Superintendent of Central Excise had inspected the premises of the respondent-assessee, whereas the show cause notice was issued on 26th June,",
        "31. The department could not establish that there was any suppression of facts or a fraud on the part of the respondent-assessee. We find that the honest mistake committed in maintenance of stock register etc. was frankly admitted by the Managing Director of the respondent-assessee. There is no finding to the effect that there was a fraud or willful mis-statement or suppression of facts. Thus, it is very clear that the notice was issued after expiry of the period of limitation. In the set of facts, the judgment delivered in the case of Nizam sugar (supra) would squarely be applicable. In view of the aforestated facts, we are of the view that the judgment delivered by the High Court cannot be interfered.",
        "32. In our opinion, the appellant has failed to make out a case that proviso to Section 11A of the Act was applicable. In view of the fact that no case was made out for invoking proviso under Section 11A of the Act, in our opinion, the judgment delivered by the High Court is just and proper and it deserves to be affirmed."
