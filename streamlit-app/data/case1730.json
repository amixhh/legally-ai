It was further stated that the appellant was never in charge of nor ever responsible for the conduct of business of the Company. Along with the reply an affidavit of the Company Secretary dated",
        "20. 2003 that the appellant who was the Director of erstwhile Company-XML was only a part-time, Director of the said Company and never in charge of day to day business of the Company was also filed. The MXL has also submitted a reply dated",

        "33. 2003 of the Company Secretary relied by the appellant does not appear to have been filed either before the Adjudicating Authority or the Appellate Tribunal and no such plea had been taken in the earlier communications. Shri Sundaram submits that the High Court committed error in dismissing the appeal of the appellant whereas neither there was any material nor any specific case of the Department that the appellant was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the Company. The mere fact of Company-MXL in its reply to the notice dated",
        "34. 2001 having given the names of the 13 persons as Directors of MXL does not amount to stating that all the Directors were responsible for the conduct of business of the Company. The appellant could have been prosecuted and punished for the contravention of the provisions of FERA, 1973 only after returning a finding that it was the appellant who was responsible for the conduct of business during the relevant period when remittances in question were made by MXL. The Appellate Tribunal without recording any finding that appellant was in charge of the affairs of the Company held the appellant liable, observing that there is nothing on record to show that any restriction was placed on the powers of the appellants as Directors of the Company with reference to subject transactions. The Adjudicating Authority although noticed the detailed reply given by the appellant dated",
        "35. 2003 but without returning any finding that the appellant was Director who was responsible for working of MXL at the relevant time imposed the penalty only relying on the letter of the Company Secretary where names of the persons who were in the Board of Directors were mentioned.",

Shri Sundaram further submits that with regard to a subsequent transaction, proceedings were initiated against the appellant in respect to transaction of MXL where the plea of the appellant that he was only a part-time, non- executive Director and had no executive role or function in the Company was accepted and proceedings were dropped insofar as the appellant is concerned by order dated",

        "38. Learned Additional Solicitor General refuting the submissions of the counsel for the appellant contends that penalty has rightly been imposed on the appellant. He submits that admittedly the appellant was Director during the relevant period which fact was admitted too in the reply given to the show cause notice. The show cause notice was issued against all the Directors including the appellant and no effort has been made by the appellant to disprove the allegations made against him. Learned Additional Solicitor General submits that there needs no specific complaint in proceedings of FERA, 1973 as opposed to complaint under Negotiable Instruments Act. When the proceedings have been initiated under Section 51 of the FERA, 1973, the burden is on the appellant to prove that he had no role to play on behalf of the Company.",
        "39. Learned counsel for the parties have placed reliance on few decisions of this Court which shall be referred to while considering the submissions of the parties in detail.",
        "40. From the submissions made by the parties and materials on records following points arise for determination in this appeal: (1) Whether the plea taken by the appellant in its reply dated",
        "41. 2003 that he was only a part-time, non-executive Director and was never in charge of nor even responsible for the conduct of business of the Company at the relevant time was an afterthought, since, in the reply given by the Company Secretary dated",

(2) Whether the appellant has not brought any material on record either before the Adjudicating Authority or the Appellate Tribunal to prove that he was only a part- time, non-executive Director not responsible for the conduct of business of the Company at the time of commission of the offence? (3) Whether the Adjudicating Authority, Appellate Tribunal and the High Court erred in holding contravention of provisions of Section 8(3), 8(4) and Section 68 of FERA, 1973 by the appellant without their being any material that the appellant was responsible for the conduct of business of the Company at the time of commission of the offence and without recording any specific findings to that effect? POINT NO.1",
        "43.

The High Court committed error in observing that plea taken by the appellant in its reply dated",
        "70. 2003 was afterthought, since, no such plea was taken in reply to the show cause notice dated",
        "71. As noted above the notice dated",

        "102. 2003 clearly stating that the appellant who was Director of the erstwhile MXL was only a part time Director of the said Company and was never in charge of the day to day business of the Company was very much on the record of the adjudicating officer and the High Court erred in holding that the said material was not filed before the Adjudging Authority or the Appellate Tribunal.",

        "104. 2003 relied by the appellant was not filed which, as noted above, is not correct. There was nothing on record brought on behalf of the Department that the above plea of the appellant was incorrect and it was the appellant who was responsible for the conduct of business of the Company at the relevant time.",
        "105. We, thus, are of the view that the material was brought by the appellant on the record that he was a part-time, non-executive Director not in charge of the affairs of the Company at the relevant time, which was erroneously refused to be considered. POINT NO.3",

        "108. 2003 filed on behalf of the appellant and Adjudicating Authority has extracted several paragraphs of the reply of the appellant. Paragraph 10 of the reply has been extensively quoted by the Adjudicating Authority specially sub-paragraph (1), (2) and (3) which are to the following effect: 10 It is prayed that the proceedings initiated may kindly be dropped on the following amongst other main grounds, which are set out hereinafter without prejudice to one another and are in addition to the facts and submission set forth hereinabove (1) That the Notice was a decorative part time non-executive Director and the Board Meetings attended by him have only been in his capacity as a part-time non- executive Director and not in any other capacity. The Noticee was never in the employment of the company and never ever had nay executive role or function in the Company. A copy of the Affidavit filed by the noticee with his reply to Show Cause Notice No.T-4/337/DZ/2002 dated",

This Notice has been never engaged in day to day conduct of the business of MXL. He has never entered into any import agreement. He has never issued any instructions to any person or the bank for causing any remittance abroad and as such he is not responsible for liable at all in any manner.

(3) This Noticee was never in charge of the day to day business of MXL and had no knowledge of the transactions in respect of which the above referred Show Cause Notice dated",
        "115. 2003 had been issued much less any intent or knowledge of alleged contraventions as set forth therein. The certificates of compliances given by MXL management to the Board prove and establish that the contraventions alleged in the above referred Notice and the subject Memorandum, in any view of the matter if occurred, were without the knowledge and had nothing to do with the transactions in question, the question of this Noticee committing consciously or deliberately any contravention of the FERA or any other law or regulations does not arise and no penalty can in law be imposed on this Noticee. The adjudication proceedings are otherwise not maintainable in law.",
        "116. After noticing the above plea of the appellant, the Adjudicating Authority has noticed that letter dated",
        "117. 2001 of the Company Secretary where he has given the names of 13 Directors and after noticing the aforesaid 13 Directors the Adjudicating Authority has recorded its conclusion in following words: I have also gone through the replies received from other directors and found that they were not responsible for day to day activities of the company and were not the Directors during the relevant period which was between",

Bhupinder Kumar Modi, Umesh Kumar Modi, John Rodger Miligan, James Campbell White and Shailendra Swarup who were Directors at relevant time and responsible for working of the M/s Modi Xerox Ltd.,I hereby find them guilty and impose a penalty of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) each on S/Sh. Bhupinder Kumar Modi, Umesh Kumar Modi, John Rodger Miligan, James Campbell White and Shailendra Swarup and Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs only) on M/s Modi Xerox Ltd. for contravention of Section 8(3) read with Section 8(4) and Section 68 of FERA, 1973, I also find the other directors were not joined the company at relevant time when the transaction had taken place and were not responsible for the conduct of the company, hence I drop the charges against S/Sh.

        "120. There is no consideration of pleas of the appellant as has been extracted by the adjudicating officer himself as noted above specially in paragraph 10(1), 10(2) and 10(3) of the reply. The adjudicating officer has not even held that the pleas taken by the appellant were untenable. The adjudicating officer, thus, has imposed the penalty without returning a finding that it was the appellant who was liable for contravention of the provisions of Section 8(3), 8(4) and Section 68 of the FERA,",
        "121. The order of the adjudicating officer, thus, is unsustainable on the above ground also.",
        "122. The Appellate Tribunal has also not considered the above plea of the appellant and by making general observation that management of the Company is to be handled by the Board of Directors, hence, the appellant being Director is held guilty. No finding has been returned by the Appellate Tribunal that the appellant was not a part- time, non-executive Director and was responsible for the conduct of business of the Company at the relevant time.",
        "123. We may also notice few judgments of this Court some of which have also been referred to by the learned counsel for the parties. A three-Judge Bench judgment in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. Neeta Bhalla and another, (2005) 8 SCC 89 , had occasion to consider the provisions of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1981 which provisions are pari materia to Section 68 of the FERA,",
        "124. Section 68 of the FERA, 1973 deals with Offences by Companies and is to the following effect:",
        "125. Offences by companies.— (1) Where a person committing a contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule, direction or order made thereunder is a company, every person who, at the time of the contravention was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct of business of the company as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly: Provided that nothing contained in this sub- section shall render any such person liable to punishment if he proves that the contravention took place without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent such contravention. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub- section (1), where a contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule, direction or order made thereunder has been committed by a company and it is proved that the contravention has taken place with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. Explanation.—For the purposes of this section— (I) company means any body corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals; and (ii) director, in relation to a firm, means a partner in the firm.",
        "126. In the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 initially there was no provision regarding offences by Companies and by Act 66 of 1988 Section 141 was inserted in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 which provision is to the following effect: Section",
        "127. Offences by companies.—(1) If the person committing an offence under section 138 is a company, every person who, at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly: Provided that nothing contained in this sub- section shall render any person liable to punishment if he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge, or that he had exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence: Provided further that where a person is nominated as a Director of a company by virtue of his holding any office or employment in the Central Government or State Government or a financial corporation owned or controlled by the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, he shall not be liable for prosecution under this Chapter. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub- section (1), where any offence under this Act has been committed by a company and it is proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to, any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, — (a) company means anybody corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals; and (b) director, in relation to a firm, means a partner in the firm.",
        "128. A bare reading of Section 141 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 indicates that sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of Section 141 are pari materia to Section 68 of FERA, 1973 which was already in the statute. This Court in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals (supra) had occasion to consider the requirements of Section",
        "129. In paragraph 4 this Court lays down following:",
        "130. ....The normal rule in the cases involving criminal liability is against vicarious liability, that is, no one is to be held criminally liable for an act of another. This normal rule is, however, subject to exception on account of specific provision being made in statutes extending liability to others. Section 141 of the Act is an instance of specific provision which in case an offence under Section 138 is committed by a Company, extends criminal liability for dishonour of cheque to officers of the Company. Section 141 contains conditions which have to be satisfied before the liability can be extended to officers of a company. Since the provision creates criminal liability, the conditions have to be strictly complied with. The conditions are intended to ensure that a person who is sought to be made vicariously liable for an offence of which the principal accused is the Company, had a role to play in relation to the incriminating act and further that such a person should know what is attributed to him to make him liable. In other words, persons who had nothing to do with the matter need not be roped in. A company being a juristic person, all its deeds and functions are result of acts of others. Therefore, officers of a Company who are responsible for acts done in the name of the Company are sought to be made personally liable for acts which result in criminal action being taken against the Company. It makes every person who. at the time the offence was committed, was incharge of and was responsible to the Company for the conduct of business of the Company, the Company, liable for the offence. The proviso to the sub-section contains an escape route for persons who are able to prove that the offence was committed without their knowledge or that they had exercised all due diligence to prevent commission of the offence.",
        "131. This Court held that the criminal liability arises from being in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the Company at the relevant time. Elaborating the requirement for a person to be made liable under Section 141 this Court laid down following in paragraphs 10 and 12:",
        "132. While analysing Section 141 of the Act, it will be seen that it operates in cases where an offence under Section 138 is committed by a company. The key words which occur in the Section are every person. These are general words and take every person connected with a company within their sweep. Therefore, these words have been rightly qualified by use of the words who, at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence etc. What is required is that the persons who are sought to be made criminally liable under Section 141 should be at the time the offence was committed, in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company. Every person connected with the company shall not fall within the ambit of the provision. It is only those persons who were in charge of and responsible for conduct of business of the company at the time of commission of an offence, who will be liable for criminal action. It follows from this that if a director of a Company who was not in charge of and was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time, will not be liable under the provision. The liability arises from being in charge of and responsible for conduct of business of the company at the relevant time when the offence was committed and not on the basis of merely holding a designation or office in a company. Conversely, a person not holding any office or designation in a Company may be liable if he satisfies the main requirement of being in charge of and responsible for conduct of business of a Company at the relevant time. Liability depends on the role one plays in the affairs of a Company and not on designation or status. If being a Director or Manager or Secretary was enough to cast criminal liability, the Section would have said so. Instead of every person the section would have said every Director, Manager or Secretary in a Company is liable....etc. The legislature is aware that it is a case of criminal liability which means serious consequences so far as the person sought to be made liable is concerned. Therefore, only persons who can be said to be connected with the commission of a crime at the relevant time have been subjected to action.",
        "133. The conclusion is inevitable that the liability arises on account of conduct, act or omission on the part of a person and not merely on account of holding an office or a position in a company. Therefore, in order to bring a case within Section 141 of the Act the complaint must disclose the necessary facts which make a person liable.",
        "134. The ratio of the above judgment has been reiterated by this Court in N.K. Wahi vs. Shekhar Singh and others, (2007) 9 SCC 481 , National Small Industries Corporation Limited vs. Harmeet Singh Paintal and another, (2010) 3 SCC 330 and Pooja Ravinder Devidasani vs. State of Maharashtra and another, (2014) 16 SCC 1 .",
        "135. Learned Additional Solicitor General placed reliance on the judgment of this Court reported in N. Rangachari vs. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd., (2007) 5 SCC 108 . This Court in Rangachari was again considering the provisions of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,",
        "136. Learned Additional Solicitor General relied on paragraphs 17 to",
        "137. In N. Rangachari this Court has noticed the earlier three-Judge judgment in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd.(supra) and clearly held that the said judgment is binding. In paragraph 20 of N. Rangachari, this Court laid down following:",
        "138. In other words, the law laid down by this Court is that for making a Director of a Company liable for the offences committed by the Company Under Section 141 of the N.I. Act, there must be specific averments against the Director showing as to how and in what manner the Director was responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company.",
        "139. Thus, what was held in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd.(supra) has been reiterated by N. Rangachari. We may also refer to paragraph 23 of the N. Rangachari judgment where following has been laid down:",
        "140. In the light of the ratio in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (2005) 8 SCC 89 , what is to be looked into is whether in the complaint, in addition to asserting that the appellant and another are the Directors of the company, it is further alleged that they are in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company. We find that such an allegation is clearly made in the complaint which we have quoted above. Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant argued that in Saroj Kumar Poddar case (2007) 3 SCC 693 , this Court had found the complaint unsustainable only for the reason that there was no specific averment that at the time of issuance of the cheque that was dishonoured, the persons named in the complaint were in charge of the affairs of the company. With great respect, we see no warrant for assuming such a position in the context of the binding ratio in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and in view of the position of the Directors in a company as explained above.",
        "141. In the facts of the above case this Court held that allegations were clearly made out in the complaint. Judgment of this Court in N. Rangachari, thus, does not help the respondent nor it, in any manner, dilute the ratio of three-Bench judgment in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd.(supra).",
        "142. We may notice one more judgment of this Court, National Small Industries Corporation Limited Vs. Harmeet Singh Paintal and Another, (2010) 3 SCC 330 , interpreting Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,",
        "143. After extracting Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act dealing with offences by companies, this Court in paragraph 12 and 13 laid down:-",
        "144. It is very clear from the above provision that what is required is that the persons who are sought to be made vicariously liable for a criminal offence under Section 141 should be, at the time the offence was committed, was in- charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company. Every person connected with the company shall not fall within the ambit of the provision. Only those persons who were in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of commission of an offence will be liable for criminal action. It follows from the fact that if a Director of a Company who was not in-charge of and was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time, will not be liable for a criminal offence under the provisions. The liability arises from being in- charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time when the offence was committed and not on the basis of merely holding a designation or office in a company.",
        "145. Section 141 is a penal provision creating vicarious liability, and which, as per settled law, must be strictly construed. It is therefore, not sufficient to make a bald cursory statement in a complaint that the Director (arrayed as an accused) is in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company without anything more as to the role of the Director. But the complaint should spell out as to how and in what manner Respondent No. 1 was in-charge of or was responsible to the accused company for the conduct of its business. This is in consonance with strict interpretation of penal statutes, especially, where such statutes create vicarious liability.",
        "146. In the above case, this Court held that Directors can be prosecuted only if they were in-charge and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. In paragraph 36, following has been laid down:-",
        "147. Section 291 of the Companies Act provides that",
        "148. General powers of Board.—(1) Subject to the provisions of that Act, the Board of Directors of a company shall be entitled to exercise all such powers, and to do all such acts and things, as the company is authorized to exercise and do. A company, though a legal entity, can act only through its Board of Directors. The settled position is that a Managing Director is prima facie in-charge of and responsible for the companys business and affairs and can be prosecuted for offences by the company. But insofar as other Directors are concerned, they can be prosecuted only if they were in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company.",
        "149. Section 68 of FERA, 1973 deals with Offences by companies. Section 68(1) provides that ……………every person who, at the time of the contravention was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct of business of the company as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the contravention………….. Section 68(1) creates a legal fiction, i.e., shall be deemed to be guilty. The legal fiction triggers on fulfilment of conditions as contained in the section. The words every person who, at the time of the contravention was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct of business has to be given some meaning and purpose. The provision cannot be read to mean that whosoever was a Director of a company at the relevant time when contravention took place, shall be deemed to be guilty of the contravention. Had the legislature intended that all the Directors irrespective of their role and responsibilities shall be deemed to be guilty of contravention, the section could have been worded in different manner. When a person is proceeded with for committing an offence and is to be punished, necessary ingredients of the offence as required by Section 68 should be present.",
        "150. We may notice that Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which was inserted in Negotiable Instruments Act by amendment in the year 1988 contains the same conditions for a person to be proceeded with and punished for offence as contained in Section 68 of FERA,",
        "151. Section 141(1) of Negotiable Instruments Act uses the same expression every person, who, at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence. Section 68 of FERA, 1973 as well as Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act deals with the offences by the companies in the same manner. The ratio of the judgments of this Court on Section 141 of Negotiable Instruments Act as noted above are also clearly relevant while interpreting Section 68 of FERA Act. We, thus, hold that for proceeding against a Director of a company for contravention of provisions of FERA, 1973, the necessary ingredient for proceeding shall be that at the time offence was committed, the Director was in charge of and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company. The liability to be proceeded with for offence under Section 68 of FERA, 1973 depends on the role one plays in the affairs of the company and not on mere designation or status. This Court in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra) while elaborating the ambit and scope of Section 141 of Negotiable Instruments Act has already laid down above in paragraph 10 of the judgment as extracted above.",
        "152. It is true that with regard to any offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act with respect to offences by companies, a complaint in writing has to be filed as required by Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. A complaint as contemplated for offence under Section 138 needs to be necessarily contain all allegations constituting offence. In FERA, 1973 for imposing a penalty under Section 50, the adjudicating officer is required to hold an enquiry after giving the person a reasonable opportunity for making a representation in the matter. Even though, FERA, 1973 does not contemplate filing of a written complaint but in proceedings as contemplated by Section 51, the person, who has to be proceeded with has to be informed of the contravention for which penalty proceedings are initiated. The expression after giving that person a reasonable opportunity for making a representation in the matter as occurring in Section 51 itself contemplate due communication of the allegations of contravention and unless allegations contains complete ingredients of offence within the meaning of Section 68, it cannot be said that a reasonable opportunity for making a representation in the matter has been given to the person, who is to be proceeded with.",
        "153. Learned ASG is right in his submission that FERA, 1973 does not contemplate any complaint but the Scheme of the Act indicate that a person, who is to be proceeded with has to be made aware of the necessary allegations, which may constitute an offence on his part. This Court in N. Rangachari (supra) has observed that a person in the commercial world having a transaction with company is entitled to presume that the Directors of the company are in charge of the affairs of the company. The presumption of a person in the commercial world is a rebuttable presumption and when adjudicating authority proceeds to impose a penalty for a contravention of FERA, 1973, essential ingredients constituting an offence under the FERA read with Section 68 has to be communicated to the person proceeded with to enable him to make effective representation in the matter.",
        "154. Learned Additional Solicitor General also submitted that all the three Courts have held and found contravention proved by the appellant, this Court may not interfere with such conclusion. We have already noticed above that the plea of the appellant that he was part-time, non-executive Director not in charge of the conduct of business of the Company at the relevant time was erroneously discarded by the authorities and the High Court and there is no finding by any of the authorities after considering the material that it was the appellant who was responsible for the conduct of business of the Company at the relevant time. Thus, present is a case where the liability has been fastened on the appellant without there being necessary basis for any such conclusion.",
        "155. It is also relevant to notice that an order which was passed on",
        "156. 2004 by the Deputy Director in adjudication proceedings although with regard to different period, the plea of the appellant that he was only a part-time, non- executive Director and not responsible of the conduct of business of the Company was accepted and notice was discharged against the appellant. The order dated",
        "157. 2004 although related to different period but has categorically noticed the status of the appellant as part- time non-executive Director. There being decision of Adjudicating Authority, in the recent past, passed on",
        "158. 2004, that the appellant was only a part-time non- executive Director of MXL, there has to be some reasons for taking a contrary view by the adjudicating officer in order dated",
        "159. 2004 with regard to affairs of the same company, i.e., MXL.",
        "160. In view of the foregoing discussions, we are of the view that the adjudicating officer has erroneously imposed penalty on the appellant for the alleged offence under Section 8(3), 8(4) and 68 of the FERA, 1973 which order was erroneously affirmed both by the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court."
