It was held that the nature of enforcement proceedings is materially different from the proceedings for adjudication of the consumer dispute. The Order passed in an Execution Petition was not amenable to a challenge before the National Commission in exercise of its Revisional Jurisdiction.",
        "42. Aggrieved by the Order dated",
        "43. 2018 passed by the Delhi High Court, the Appellant filed the present Appeal.",
        "44. The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that:",
        "45. A Revision Petition is maintainable before the National Commission under Section 21(b) of the 1986 Act. The revisional jurisdiction exercised by the National Commission is wide, and intended to encompass all proceedings before the State Commissions.",
        "46. The intent of Section 21(b) is clearly to provide revisional jurisdiction to the National Commission, over the State Commission. The reference under Section 21(b) is specifically to orders passed in any consumer dispute which is pending before, or has been decided by any State Commission.",
        "47. The phrase “consumer dispute” under Section 21(b) of the 1986 Act must be understood to mean any dispute which arises under the 1986 Act.",
        "48. Execution proceedings are a continuation of the original proceedings i.e. the Consumer Complaint.Reliance in this regard was placed on the judgment of this Court in Dokku Bhushayya v. Katragadda Ramakrishnayya & Ors. (1963) 2 SCR 499",
        "49. On the other hand, the Respondent who appeared in person, inter alia contended that :",
        "50. A Revision Petition is not maintainable under Section 21(b) of the 1986 Act, against an order of the State Commission passed in execution proceedings.",
        "51. The impugned judgment does not merit interference.",
        "52. Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides that the provisions of the Act shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. Therefore, the National Commission cannot go beyond the limitation placed by the CPC. Order 45, Rule 16 of CPC bars revision in execution appeals.",
        "53. An execution petition cannot be termed as a continuation of the ‘consumer dispute’. The definition of a ‘complaint’ and a ‘consumer dispute’ u/S. 2(1)(c) and (e) respectively, . cannot be given a wide interpretation to encompass execution proceedings.",
        "54. An Order in execution proceedings is not an Order in a “consumer dispute” pending before the State Commission. The “consumer dispute” filed by the Respondent – Complainant was finally adjudicated by this Court vide Judgment and Order dated",
        "55. In an execution proceeding, the executing forum only has the jurisdiction ‘to execute’ the order in accordance with Order XXI CPC.",
        "56. We have heard both the parties and perused the pleadings and written submissions filed.",
        "57. The issue which arises for our consideration in the present Appeal is whether a Revision Petition is maintainable before the National Commission u/S. 21(b) of the 1986 Act against an Order passed by the State Commission in an appeal arising out of execution proceedings.",
        "58. The right to file a Revision Petition, like an appeal, is a right conferred by statute. (P .S. Sathappan (Dead) by Lrs. v. Andhra Bank Ltd. and Ors. (2004) 11 SCC 672 ) In the absence of a statutory conferment, there is no inherent right to file a revision. Section 21 sets out the jurisdiction of the National Commission which is reproduced hereunder:“",
        "59. Jurisdiction of the National Commission. — Subject to the other provisions of . this Act, the National Commission shall have jurisdiction—(a) to entertain—(i) complaints where the value of the goods or services and compensation, if any, claimed exceeds rupees one crore; and(ii) appeals against the orders of any State Commission; and(b) to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any con sumer dispute which is pending before or has been decided by any State Commission where it appears to the National Commission that such State Commission has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or has acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity. ”(emphasis supplied)The National Commission has : (i) original jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of goods or services exceeds rupees one crore;(ii) jurisdiction to entertain appeals against Orders of any State Commission; and(iii) supervisory jurisdiction over any State Commission in any “consumer dispute” pending or decided by a State Commission, which is challenged on the ground of lack or excess of jurisdiction.",
        "60. The exercise of revisional jurisdiction u/S. 21(b) by the National Commission is limited to a consumer dispute which has been filed before the State Commission (Galada Power and T elecommunication Ltd. v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors. (2016) 14 SCC 161 ) . The jurisdiction u/S. 21(b) of the 1986 Act can be exercised by the National Commission only in case of a “consumer dispute” filed before the State Commission. The National Commission in exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction u/S. 21(b) is concerned about the correctness or otherwise of the orders passed by the State Commission in a “consumer dispute”.",
        "61. A Revision Petition has a narrower scope than an ‘appeal’. In Dattonpant Gopalvarao Devakate v. Vithalrao Maruthirao Janagaval, (1975) 2 SCC 246 this Court discussed the distinction between “appellate jurisdiction” and “revisional jurisdiction” as follows:“",
        "62. ‘Appeal’ and ‘revision’ are expressions of common usage in Indian statute and the distinction between ‘appellate jurisdiction’ and ‘revisional jurisdiction’ is well known though not well defined. Ordinarily, appellate jurisdiction involves a rehearing, as it were, on law as well as fact and is invoked by an aggrieved person. Such jurisdiction may, however, be limited in some way as, for instance has been done in the case of second appeal under the Code of Civil Procedure, and under some Rent Acts in some States. Ordinarily, again, revisional jurisdiction is analogous to a power of superintendence and may sometimes be exercised even without its being invoked by a party. The extent of revisional jurisdiction is defined by the statute conferring such jurisdiction. The conferment of revisional jurisdiction is generally for the purpose.. of keeping tribunals subordinate to the revising Tribunal within the bounds of their authority to make them act according to law, according to the procedure established by law and according to well defined principles of justice.”(emphasis supplied)",
        "63. Reference must also be made to the judgment of this Court in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. Dilbahar Singh, (2014) 9 SCC 78 wherein it was held that :“…Conceptually, revisional jurisdiction is a part of appellate jurisdiction but it is not vice¬versa. Both, appellate jurisdiction and revisional jurisdiction are creatures of statutes. No party to the proceeding has an inherent right of appeal or revision. An appeal is continuation of suit or original proceeding, as the case may be. The power of the appellate court is co¬ extensive with that of the trial court. Ordinarily, appellate jurisdiction involves re¬hearing on facts and law but such jurisdiction may be limited by the statute itself that provides for appellate jurisdiction. On the other hand, revisional jurisdiction, though, is a part of appellate jurisdiction but ordinarily it cannot be equated with that of a full¬fledged appeal. In other words, revision is not continuation of suit or of original proceeding. When the aid of revisional court is invoked on the revisional side, it can interfere within the permissible parameters provided in the statute.”(emphasis supplied)",
        "64. Ordinarily, the power of revision can be exercised only when illegality, irrationality, or impropriety is found in the decision making process of the fora below.",
        "65. The revisional jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission u/S. 21(b) is with respect to a pending or disposed of ‘consumer dispute’ before the State Commission.",
        "66. The consumer dispute, in the present case, had already been finally adjudicated by this Court vide Judgment and Order dated",
        "67. The second round of litigation emanated from the execution of the final order passed by this Court.",
        "68. Section 25 of the 1986 Act, provides for the enforcement of Orders passed by the District Forum, State Commission or National Commission. Section 25(3) states :\"",
        "69. Enforcement of orders of the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission.(3) Where any amount is due from any person under an order made by a District Forum, State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, the person entitled to the amount may make an application to the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, and such District Forum or the State Commission or the National Commission may issue a certificate for the said amount to the Collector of the district (by whatever name called) and the Collector shall proceed to recover the amount in the same manner as arrears of land revenue. \"An Order passed for enforcement, would not be an order in the ‘consumer dispute’ since it stands finally decided by the appellate forum, which has conclusively determined the rights and obligations of the parties.",
        "70. The nature of execution proceedings is materially different from the nature of proceedings for adjudication of a consumer complaint. Execution proceedings are independent proceedings. Orders passed for enforcement of the final order in the Consumer dispute, cannot be construed to be orders passed in the ‘consumer dispute’.",
        "71. During the course of the hearing, learned Counsel for the Appellant raised a contention that execution proceedings are a continuation of the ‘appeal’, and must therefore be considered to be a continuation of the ‘consumer dispute’. Reliance in this regard was placed on the decision of the Bombay High Court in Satguru Construction Co. Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Greater Bombay Co¬operative Bank Ltd., 2007 (3) MhLJ",
        "72. and Raghunath R. Shingate v. Jayant Gajanan Pathak & Ors., 2011 (6) MhLJ",
        "73. as well as the Patna High Court in M/s. Parshava Properties Ltd. v. A.K. Bose, AIR 1979 Pat 308 . wherein it was held that execution proceedings are a continuation of the Suit.",
        "74. On the other hand, the Respondent – Complainant has placed reliance on a Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Guntupalli Rama Subbayya v. Guntupalli Rajamma, AIR 1988 AP 226 . wherein it was held that :“Execution Proceedings, in our view, cannot be regarded as continuation of the suit in the sense in which the proceedings in appeal are treated.”(emphasis supplied)",
        "75. A Full Bench of the Patna High Court in Masomat Narmada Devi & Anr. v. Nandan Singh & Ors., AIR 1987 Pat 33 . has similarly held that execution proceedings cannot be regarded as a continuation of the Suit.",
        "76. We affirm the view taken by the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and Patna High Court. Execution proceedings even though they are proceedings in a suit, cannot be considered to be a continuation of the original suit. Execution proceedings are separate and independent proceedings for execution of the decree. The merits of the claim or dispute, cannot be considered during execution proceedings. They are independent proceedings initiated by the decree holder to enforce the decree passed in the substantive dispute.",
        "77. There is no remedy provided under Section 21 to file a Revision Petition against an Order passed in appeal by the State Commission in execution proceedings. Section 21(b) does not provide for filing of a Revision Petition before the National Commission against an Order passed by the State Commission in execution proceedings.",
        "78. In the present case, the National Commission committed a jurisdictional error by entertaining the Revision Petition u/S. 21(b) filed by the Appellant – Board against an appeal filed before the State Commission, in Execution proceedings.",
        "79. The National Commission erroneously allowed the Revision Petition u/S. 21(b) which was not maintainable. Furthermore, the National Commission modified the decree passed by this Court vide Order dated",
        "80. 2012 wherein this Court had directed the Board to pay Interest @ 18% p.a. on the principal amount of Rs. 2,67,750/¬ (which included an amount of Rs. 3,937 which had been initially deducted by the Board). The National Commission has awarded Interest on the amount of Rs. 3,937/- twice, by first including it in the principal amount of Rs. 2,67,750/¬; and thereafter awarding Interest @ 18% on the same amount of Rs. 3,937/¬, which would amount to a double payment."
