        "87. The claim of the Principal as well as respondent No.1 that it is the Principal who is the appointing authority of Warden of the College Hostel is based on letter of the University Grants Commission dated",
        "88. The letter dated",

        "91. Though the Warden has been desired to be provided for the womens hostels, it is felt that each hostel should have a warden who should be responsible for all hostel administration in the college and he/she should be appointed by the Principal from amongst senior teachers in the college. As an incentive for this extra work an allowance of Rs.300/- pm be paid.

The emphasis has been laid by the counsel for respondent No.2-University of Delhi on the following sentence occurring in the letter: …it is felt that each hostel should have a warden who should be responsible for all hostel administration in the college and he/she should be appointed by the Principal from amongst senior teachers in the college.",

        "101. A careful reading of the aforesaid letter indicates that the decision of the Commission which was communicated by the Secretary was the decision of the University Grants Commission to provide additional staff for smooth functioning of the Hostel of the College. The Commission neither took decision regarding appointment of the Warden nor such decision was communicated by the said letter.",

(ii) Sanction for a few additional posts for smooth functioning of Hostel activities.",
        "113. A perusal of the above minutes of the Executive Council of the Delhi University indicates that what Executive Council noticed in the minutes is that the Commission has approved the raising of the funding pattern of salaries of the employees of the Hostel from 75% to 95% and the remaining 5% of the expenditure was to be made by the Management as in the case of College administration with no financial burden on the students residing in the Hostels. Only to the extent of the above part of the decision of the Commission the Executive Council reiterated and there was no decision by the University that appointment of Warden of the Hostel is to be made by the Principal of the College.",
        "114. The University has filed counter-affidavit in the writ petition before the High Court where it has categorically taken the stand that the University Act, Statutes and Ordinance do not provide for appointment of the Warden of the Hostel College and it is a private matter concerning the respective college. In the LPA affidavit was called for and the affidavit dated",
        "115. 2019 by Prof. T.K. Das, Registrar, University of Delhi was filed. In paragraph 5 of the said affidavit following has been stated:",

The appointment of an existing teaching staff in an honorary capacity as Warden of a college is not specifically provided for under any of the provisions of University of Delhi Act, 1922 statutes, and Ordinance; being a private matter concerning the respective college and University of Delhi has no role to play. However, all the collages, which have their own hostel and, are affiliated or constituted of University of Delhi follow the practice of inviting applications from interested teachers of their respective college by putting up notice by the Principal of said College, willing to take on this honorary charge. Then the Principal of the respective college considers such application received and recommends/shortlist the name for such appointment. Thereafter, the name of shortlisted teacher and appointed to the honorary post of warden is placed before the Governing Body for approval.",

        "123. 2016 has rightly held that University Grants Commissions letter dated",
        "124. 1987 is of no avail.",
        "125. Much emphasis has been laid by the learned counsel for the respondent on Ordinance XVIII which deals with Of Colleges and Halls. Ordinance XVIII, 6-A deals with Staff Council. 6-A relevant for the present case is quoted hereunder: 6-A. (1) There shall be a Staff Council in every College. (2) All the members of the teaching staff, the Librarian and the Director of Physical Education shall constitute the Staff Council. (3) Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Statutes and the Ordinances of the University, the Principal shall act as Principal-in-Council in respect of matters on which Staff Council is required to take decisions. ORDINANCE XVIII (4) (a) The Principal shall be ex-officio Chairman of the Staff Council. (b) The Council shall elect its Secretary, who shall hold office for a term of one year. The Secretary may be re-elected for a second term but no person shall hold office of Secretary for more than two consecutive terms. (5) (a) Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Statutes and the Ordinances of the University, the Staff Council shall take decisions in respect of the following matters: (i) Preparation of College time-table. (ii) Allocation of extra-curricular work of teachers not involving, payment of remuneration. (iii) Organising extra-curricular activities, including cultural activities of students, sports, games, National Service Scheme and other social services schemes and academic societies. (iv) Laying down guide-lines for purchase of library books and laboratory equipment in consultation with the appropriate departments. (v) Organising admission of students. (b) Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Statutes and the Ordinances of the University, the Staff Council shall make recommendations in respect of the following matters : (i) Formulation of recommendations on introduction of new teaching posts in the departments and expansion of the existing departments; (ii) Formulation of admission policy within the framework of the policy laid down by the University; (iii) Formulation of guidelines regarding arrangements for the residence and welfare of students in consultation with appropriate students organisations; (iv) Formulation of guide-lines regarding discipline of the students; (v) Formulation of policies for recommending names of teachers for participation in seminars and conferences and financial assistance to teachers. Note : The administrative staff of the College will not be within the purview of the Staff Council.",
        "126. The reliance has been placed on 6-A(5)(b)(iii), formulation of guidelines regarding arrangements for the residence and welfare of students in consultation with appropriate students organisations. When we read the Ordinance 6-A which deals with the Staff Council of every College, clause (5)(a) provides that subject to the provisions of the Act, the Statutes and the Ordinances of the University, the Staff Council has to take decisions in respect of the matters enumerated therein. There is reliance only on clause (5)(b)(iii) which is extracted above. Clause (5)(b) provides that subject to the provisions of the Act, the Statutes and the Ordinances of the University, the Staff Council shall make recommendations in respect of the matters mentioned therein. Formulation of guidelines regarding arrangements for the residence and welfare of students in consultation with appropriate students organisations, in no manner can embrace in it the power to make appointment of Warden. It has been clearly stated by the University in its letters and affidavit that it is a matter of administration of the College and is not dealt in the Act, Statutes and Ordinances. Had the Ordinance 6-A(5)(b)(iii) contemplated recommendation of Staff Council for appointment of Warden, the University could have very well taken that stand which stand has not been taken in the present proceedings.",
        "127. The Delhi University has also filed a counter- affidavit in the proceedings before this Court. In the counter-affidavit filed by the University of Delhi in these proceedings, the stand of University of Delhi has again been taken in paragraph 4 which is to the following effect:",
        "128. The appointment of Warden of the hostel maintained by the College constituent/affiliated to the University of Delhi is purely an administrative affair of the College and the University has no role to play in this behalf. It is respectfully submitted that the appointment of an existing teaching staff in an honorary capacity as Warden of a college is not specifically provided for under any of the provisions of the University of Delhi Act, 1922 Statutes, and Ordinances. However all the Colleges, which have their own Hostel and, are affiliated or constituent of University of Delhi, follow the practice of inviting application from interested teachers of their respective College by putting up notice by the Principal of said College, willing to take up the honorary charge. Then the Principal of the respective College considers such application received and recommends/shortlist the name for such appointment. Thereafter, the name of the shortlisted teacher to be appointed to the honorary post of Warden is placed before the Governing Body of the said college for approval. This practice has been in vogue, more or the less in the light of the letter of UGC dated",
        "129. 1987 (Annexure P-2 herein). The Hindu college for instance also follows the same practice.",
        "130. In the counter-affidavit of the University referring to practice, the University clearly states that appointment of Warden is purely an administrative affair of the College and the University has no role to play and further the same is not provided for under any of the provisions of the University of Delhi Act, Statutes and Ordinances. We, thus, come to the conclusion that Ordinance XVIII 6-A(5)(b)(iii) does not empower the Staff Council to make any recommendation with regard to the appointment of Warden of the College Hostel.",
        "131. The Governing Body of the College is to administer the affair of the College. Ordinance XVIII Chapter VII-2 at page 47 of the paper book is to the following effect:",
        "132. The Governing Body will meet at least once in a term, and, subject as hereinafter provided, shall have general supervision and control of the affairs of the College and maintain its own records of its proceedings which shall be open to inspection by the inspection authority.",
        "133. The Governing Body, thus, has general supervision of the College. Even in the Colleges and Institutions which are maintained by the University, it is provided in Ordinance XX that the Governing Body which is constituted by the Executive Council is empowered to appoint the administrative staff of the College. Similarly, the Governing Body of the affiliated Colleges is empowered to appoint administrative staff of the College. The Ordinance does not empower the Principal to make any appointment of the Warden of the Hostel nor any other statutory provision has been referred which empowers the Principal to appoint Warden of the College.",
        "134. The Principal, however, who is entrusted the over all internal administration of the College is a person who knows all the staff of the College and his/her recommendation with regard to appointment of Warden of the College Hostel is to carry weight. The Governing Body while making appointment of Warden of the College Hostel has to give due weight to the recommendation of Principal. The appointment of Warden of the Hostel is made from amongst the permanent staff of the College, the practice which is followed in the College and with which there is no dispute between the parties is that the applications are invited through notice by Principal for appointment of Warden and after recommendation is made by the Principal, a decision is taken by the Governing Body is to appoint Warden.",
        "135. With regard to the role of Staff Council in the appointment of Warden of the Hostel, we have already observed that Ordinances do not empower the Staff Council to make any recommendation with regard to the appointment of Warden. We have found that the Principal has no authority to appoint Dr. Asha- respondent No.1 as Warden in the Hostel of the College and appointment made by the Principal was irregular. The Division Bench also did not interfere with the judgment of the learned Single Judge. The Division Bench in the directions in paragraph 41 has directed that the applications received in response to notice for appointment of Warden to be placed before the Staff Council which was to take a decision and make recommendations on the said applications. We having found that Staff Council is not statutorily empowered to make any recommendation regarding appointment of Warden of the College Hostel, the direction of the Division Bench requiring placement of all applications before the Staff Council was uncalled for. The appointment of Warden of the Hostel being in the domain of the Governing Body, the High Court should have left it to the Governing Body to take appropriate steps along with the Principal of the College for making appointment of the Warden of the Hostel of the College."
