        "56. 2 The Bank has complied with the statutory requirements under S. 25F of the I.D. Act which lays down the conditions that an employer must comply, on the retrenchment of a workman. In the present case, the High Court has held that the Appellant hadabandoned her job, on her refusal to accept any of the alternative positions with the bank, on the same pay scale.",
        "57. 3 The concept of abandonment has been discussed at length in a Judgment delivered by a 3-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in The Buckingham & Carnatic Co. Ltd. v Venkatiah & Ors. (1964) 4 SCR 265 wherein it was held that abandonment of service can be inferred from the existing facts and circumstances which prove that the employee intended to abandon service. This case was followed by a two judge bench in Vijay S Sathaye v Indian Airlines Ltd. & Ors. (2013) 10 SCC 253 In the case before us, the intentions of the Appellant can be inferred from her refusal to accept any of the 4 alternative positions offered by the R2-Bank. It is an admitted position that the alternative positions were on the same pay scale, and did not involve any special training or technical knowhow. In any event, the claims raised by the Appellant before various forums were with respect to enhancement of compensation, which are monetary in nature. The Appellants conduct would constitute a voluntary abandonment of service, since the Appellant herself had declined to accept the various offers of service in the Bank. Furthermore, even during conciliationproceedings she has only asked for an enhanced severance package, and not reinstatement. Once it is established that the Appellant had voluntarily abandoned her service, she could not have been in continuous service as defined under S. 2(oo) the I.D. Act,",
        "58. S. 25F of the I.D. Act, 1947 lays down the conditions that are required to be fulfilled by an employer, while terminating the services of an employee, who has been incontinuous service of the employer. Hence, S. 25F of the I.D. Act, would cease to apply on her. The condition precedent for Retrenchment of an employee, as provided in S. 25F of the I.D. Act, 1947 was discussed by a Constitution Bench of this Court inHathisingh Manufacturing Ltd.vUnion of India AIR 1960 SC 923 , while deciding the constitutional validity of S. 25FFF. The Constitution Bench held,",
        "59. …Under Section 25-F, no workman employed in an industrial undertaking can be retrenched by the employer until (a) the workman has been given one months notice in writing indicating the reasons for retrenchment and the period has expired or the workman has been paid salary in lieu of such notice, (b) the workman has been paid retrenchment compensation equivalent to 15 days average salary for every completed year of service and (c) notice in the prescribed manner is served on the appropriate Government….By S. 25F a prohibition against retrenchment, until the conditions prescribed by that Section are fulfilled in imposed. S. 25F of the I.D. Act, 1947 is extracted herein below: 25F. Conditions precedent to retrenchment of workmen.- No workman employed in any industry who has been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall be retrenched by that employer until— (a) The workman has been given one months notice in writing indicating the reasons for retrenchment and the period of notice has expired, or the workman has been paid in lieu of such notice, wages for the period of the notice; (b) the workman has been paid, at the time of retrenchment, compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days average pay [for every completed year of continuous service] or any part thereof in excess of six months; and (c) notice in the prescribed manner is served on the appropriate Government [or such authority as may be specified by the appropriate Government by notification in the Official Gazette]. In the present case, the R2-Bank has paid the Appellant a sum of Rs. 8,17,071/-, which included 6 months pay in lieu of Notice under S. 25F(a) and an additional amount calculated on the basis of 15 days salary multiplied by the number of years of service, in compliance with S. 25F(b). However, no Notice was sent to the Appropriate Government or authority notified, in compliance with S. 25F(c) of the I.D. Act. A three Judge Bench of this Court in Gurmail Singh & Ors. v State of Punjab & Ors. (1991) 1 SCC 189 Held that the requirement of clause (c) of S. 25F can be treated only as directory and not mandatory. This was followed in Pramod Jha & ors. v State of Bihar & Ors. (2003) 4 SCC 619 wherein it was held that compliance with S. 25F(c) is not mandatory.",
        "60. 4 The Appellant has admittedly received an amount of Rs. 1,07,73,736/- under various heads: table The Appellant has claimed an amount of Rs.",
        "61. 99 lakhs. The Appellant has already received almost double the amount claimed by her."
