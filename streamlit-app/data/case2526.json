As the respondent did not hand over the properties to the petitioner – Kaushaliya, which she was required to hand over as per the order passed by this Court she has preferred the present Contempt Petition No.1868 of 2018 alleging non¬ compliance of the order passed by this Court in SLP (C) No.10022 of 2016 by the respondent father – Jodha Ram.

Now she has come up with the plea that only a portion of the said house was in her possession which she has vacated and other portions are in possession of third parties. It is in respect thereof that execution proceedings are pending. We also find from the records that insofar as Respondent No.1/father of the petitioner is concerned, he has purchased one house which is to the liking of the petitioner herself and to show his bona fide, he has deposited the keys thereof as well with the Executing Court. His only plea is that the possession thereof should be handed over to the petitioner after he gets possession of Jodha Bhawan and Meera Bhawan. In the circumstances, we impress upon the Executing Court to expedite the execution proceedings.",

It is submitted that at the relevant time applicant No.1 Ramu Ram Vishnoi paid only Rs.51,000/- in the year 2006, however, he did not make any further payment and therefore the Agreement to Sell was cancelled by serving a legal notice in the year 2007 itself.

Thereafter the order passed by the Court in terms of the Settlement is binding to the parties and is required to be acted upon and/or complied with and as observed above the same is executable. Under the circumstances, the submission on behalf of Ramu Ram and Rampal that as the properties in question were not the subject matter of the suit before the Trial, the same could have been the subject matter of the Settlement Agreement and/or the order dated",
