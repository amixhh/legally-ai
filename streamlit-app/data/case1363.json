        "71. , there cannot be any dispute to the law laid down by this Court in Radhey Shyam v. Chhabi Nath & Ors. (supra), but in the facts of the present case, we do not propose to unsettle the judgment of the High Court on the above ground due to two reasons, firstly, in the High Court, the Appellants, who were Respondents in the Writ Petition, did not challenge the maintainability of the Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, and secondly, had the Appellants raised the above objection regarding maintainability of the Writ Petition, the course open for Plaintiffs/Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 was to amend the cause title of the writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution, and such a Writ Petition under Article 227 would have been clearly maintainable.",
        "72. The Writ Petition under Article 227 challenging the orders passed by Civil Courts refusing to grant interim injunction under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC could very well be maintainable, and the opportunity to amend the cause title by Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 by raising any objection to that effect having been denied to them, we, instead of setting aside the judgment of the High Court on the above ground, proceed to examine the contentions on merits.",
        "73. The Learned Single Judge granted an order of status quo with respect to the construction of the Electricity Sub-station even though the Plaintiffs/Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 herein had failed to produce any documentary evidence whatsoever to establish their title to the suit property.The Additional District Judge in the earlier round of litigation, in Title Appeal No. 20/1999 vide Judgment dated",

        "75. The said finding has attained finality. In this view of the matter, the Respondents failed to make out a prima facie case, which would have justified the grant of an interim injunction.",
        "76. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs/Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 also failed to establish that the Electricity Sub-station was being constructed on their land. The Respondents No. 1 to 3 failed to describe the specific area which was in their alleged possession over which the Electricity Sub-station was being constructed.",
        "77. The balance of convenience lies entirely in favour of the Appellant – The General Manager, Jharkhand State Electricity Board [in S.L.P. (C) No. 24684 of 2015] since the entire Electricity Sub-station has been fully constructed, and is now at the stage of being energised for supply of electricity inter alia to four feeders viz. Bhuiyadih (BHU), Baridih (BRD), Vidyapatinagar (VPN). It is estimated to provide electricity to approximately 1 lakh people. The Board is statutorily empowered under Section 67 of the Electricity Act, 2003 to undertake all actions necessary for transmission or supply of electricity, subject to the procedure under the Electricity Act,",
        "78. Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 have failed to produce any evidence of their possession over the vacant land, no undue hardship or prejudice would be caused to them, in the event the Appellant – The General Manager, Jharkhand State Electricity Board [in S.L.P. (C) No. 24684 of 2015] is permitted to proceed with the energisation of the Electricity sub-station.",
        "79. In the event that Respondents No. 1 to 3 are able to establish their title and possession to any part of the property utilised for the Electricity Sub-station, they would be entitled to compensation for any damage, detriment or inconvenience caused, in accordance with S. 67(3) of the Electricity Act, 2003, and/or any other law for the time being in force.",
        "80. The Electricity Sub-station is complete in all respects and ready to be energised, as per the documentary evidence placed before the Court. The overriding public interest of providing electricity to the local populace would far outweigh the alleged interest of Respondent Nos.1 to"
