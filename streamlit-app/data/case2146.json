As per the tender conditions, bidders are required to furnish necessary certificates, issued by the District Officers of R & B Department.",
        "37. It is not in dispute that the appellant owns a Hot Mix Plant and at the request of the appellant, the District Officers have issued a certificate. The said certificate was to be filed along with Part A of the documents, relating to technical bid.",
        "38. It is submitted that, as per the tender conditions, the result of evaluation of Part-I of the bids shall be made public on e-procurement systems, following which, there will be a period of five working days, during which any bidder may submit complaint which shall be considered for resolution before opening Part-II of the bid.",
        "39. It is contended that in this case, initially a certificate was furnished by the concerned District Officer of R & B Department, showing the distance below 100 kilometers but when a complaint is filed by the fourth respondent/writ petitioner, verification was done by calling a report from the Superintending Engineer, Warangal.",
        "40. It is submitted that Superintending Engineer, on its own, has certified in his report dated",
        "41. 2018 that as per the original route, the distance is",

        "43. 90 kilometers, as per the Google map.",
        "44. It is further submitted that apart from the said certification, an independent report is also called for from the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, which is reported vide report dated",
        "45. 2018, showing the distance between the Hot Mix Plant owned by the appellant and the last point of working reach of the work in question, at",
        "46. 1 kilometers. It is submitted that when a complaint is filed by the fourth respondent in terms of Para",
        "47. 6 of the Standard Bidding Document, it is always open for the authorities to call for a report from the independent authority other than the officers concerned in the circle/division in question.",
        "48. It is submitted by learned counsel that accepting the report submitted by the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, the price bid was opened and the appellant has offered to execute the work at a cost of Rs.31,31,69,",
        "49. 04, as against the cost quoted by the fourth respondent which is Rs.31,51,27,",
        "50. In view of dispute raised by the fourth respondent, the Chief Engineer concerned has sought re-verification of the distance from the Superintending Engineer, R & B Circle, Karimnagar, who, vide report dated",
        "51. 2018, based on the Trip Meter of the vehicle, had categorically opined that the Hot Mix Plant of the appellant was located within 100 kilometers. It is submitted that there being no specific mala fides, tendering authority opened the price bid only after satisfying the distance being less than 100 kilometers.",
        "52. It is submitted that as per the tender conditions, there is no prescribed procedure for verification, in the event of any complaint by one of the bidders, in terms of Para",

It is submitted that the learned Single Judge has rightly refused to exercise the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India as much as there is no illegality or arbitrariness in the decision-making process. It is submitted that the well reasoned order of the learned Single Judge is interfered in the intra court appeal by impugned order, without assigning valid reasons and findings recorded in the impugned order run contrary to the tender conditions.",
        "54. In support of his arguments, Sri B. Adinarayana Rao, learned senior counsel, has relied on the following judgments:",
        "55. Tata Cellular v. Union of India. 1994(6) SCC 651",
        "56. Raunaq International Ltd. v. I.V.R Constructions Ltd.1991(1) SCC",

        "60. On the other hand, Sri R.Basant, learned senior counsel, appearing for the fourth respondent/writ petitioner states that there are no grounds to interfere with the impugned order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court. It is submitted that the Superintending Engineer, Warangal, in his report dated",
        "61. 2018, has shown the distance at",
        "62. 50 kilometers, and at the same time, on his own, also mentioned the distance to be at",
        "63. 90 kilometers measured from an alternate route. It is further submitted that the Chief Engineer has committed error in calling the report from the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, who is not the concerned jurisdictional Superintending Engineer. When it is found that, as per the initial certificate submitted by the appellant, which shows the distance to be more than 100 kilometers, there is no reason or justification either to go by the distance, as measured from the alternate route in the report dated",
        "64. 2018, or to go by another report of the Chief Engineer, which is based on the information furnished by the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar.",
        "65. Finally, it is submitted by Sri R. Basant, learned senior counsel that there are no grounds to interfere in the impugned order in this appeal, filed under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.",
        "66. In support of his arguments, Sri R.Basant, learned Senior counsel has also relied on the following judgments:",
        "67. Poddar Steel Corporation v. Ganesh Engineering Works. (1991)3 SCC 273 .",
        "68. BSN Joshi & SWons Ltd. v. Nmair Coal Services Ltd. and Ors. (2006)11 SCC 548 .",
        "69. Bakshi Security and Personnel Services Pvt. Ltd. v. Devkishan Computed Private Limited and others. (2016)8 SCC 446 .",
        "70. Central Coalfields Limited and others v. SLL-SML and others. (2016)8 SCC 622 . Further, he has also relied on the following judgments:",
        "71. Pritam Singh v. State. AIR 1950 SC 169 .",
        "72. Penu Balakrishna Iyer & Ors. v. Ariya M. Ramaswamy Iyer & Ors. AIR 1965 SC 195 .",
        "73. Shaikh Ali Hossain & Ors. v. Shaikh Showkat Ali & Anr. (2008)8 SCC 180 wherein, the scope of interference by this Court is discussed under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.",
        "74. Having heard the learned senior counsels on both sides, we have carefully perused the impugned order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court and the order passed by learned Single Judge and other material placed on record.",
        "75. From a reading of the tender conditions relating to work in question, it is clear that the bidders shall exhibit proof of owning Batch Type Hot Mix Plant of capacity of 100-120 TPH and such plant shall be located within a distance of 100 kilometers from the last point of working reach, for which, bids are invited. In proof of owning such a plant within 100 kilometers, bidders are required to obtain necessary certificates from the concerned District Officers of R & B Department, where such plants have been located and the District Officers of R & B Department shall inspect and certify with route maps on the location; distance from the last point of work reach; and ownership of such plants, for which, bidders are intending to bid. It is clear from the aforesaid condition, which is to be construed as essential, that the bidder shall own a Hot Mix Plant within a distance of 100 kilometers from the last point of working reach. As per clause",
        "76. 6 of the tender conditions, the result of evaluation of Part-I of the bids shall be made public on e-procurement systems, following which, there shall be a period of five working days, during which, any bidder may submit complaint, which shall be considered, before opening Part-II of the bid. It is clear from the aforesaid clause under tender document, if any of the bidder disputes the distance quoted by other bidder, it is open for such bidder to make a complaint, which shall be considered, before opening of Part-II of the bid. Once a complaint is filed, there is no definite procedure prescribed as to how such complaint is to be dealt. In the case on hand, it is clear from the material on record that, when a complaint is filed by the fourth respondent/writ petitioner, after evaluation of Part-I of the bids, at first instance, a report is prepared by the Superintending Engineer, Warangal dated",
        "77. 2018, stating that as per the route given by the appellant, distance is",
        "78. 50 kilometers and if measured from the alternate route it comes to",
        "79. 90 kilometers. At this stage, it is to be mentioned that, it is the specific case of the appellant that it has not made any request for measuring the distance from the alternate route. In view of the variation in distance, from its earlier report, it appears, the Chief Engineer has requested the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, to verify and report. The Superintending Engineer, vide his report dated",
        "80. 2018, informed the Chief Engineer that he has measured the distance from the odometer and the distance between the Hot Mix Plant and the last point of working reach was",
        "81. 1 kilometers. Accepting the said report, bid of the appellant was opened and it is clear from the record that the appellant has quoted offer to execute the work in question at Rs.31,31,69,",
        "82. 04 whereas, the fourth respondent has quoted at Rs.31,51,27,",
        "83. 82 to execute the work. The offer of the appellant is nearly Rupees Twenty Lakh less than the rate quoted by the fourth respondent/writ petitioner.",
        "84. The learned Single Judge, by observing that there being no specific mala fides against any individual, has held that, no fault can be attributed to the Chief Engineer in getting the re-verification done, by obtaining a report from the independent authority. Further, by recording a finding that the scope of interference in the matter relating to tenders, in exercise of power conferred under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, is confined to decision-making process only, has dismissed the Writ Petition.",
        "85. From a reading of the impugned order, it appears that the Division Bench has reversed the order of the learned Single Judge, only on the ground that the report received from the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, is not in accordance with the procedure. The Division Bench of the High Court has also held that the Chief Engineer had stepped out of his jurisdiction, when he called a report from the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar.",
        "86. We are not convinced, with such a view, as expressed above, by the Division Bench of the High Court. First of all, it is to be noticed that there is no dispute that appellant owns a Hot Mix Plant, as required in the tender conditions. It is his specific case that the location of such Hot Mix Plant is within 100 kilometers, as required. It is true that when a complaint is made by the fourth respondent/writ petitioner, it was found that the distance is",
        "87. 50 kilometers from one route and",
        "88. 90 kilometers from the other route. From the alternate route, shown in the report dated",
        "89. 2018, submitted by the Superintending Engineer, Warangal, it is at a distance less than 100 kilometers.",
        "90. We find nothing wrong in the first report, mentioning the distance from the alternate route. In view of such discrepancy in the report, the Chief Engineer has further called for a report from the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, an independent authority, who has further, after re-verification, submitted a report dated",
        "91. 2018, stating that the distance is only",
        "92. 1 kilometers. To make sure whether the plant of the appellant is within the distance of 100 kilometers or not, in compliance of the tender conditions, in view of the dispute raised by the fourth respondent/writ petitioner and the report dated",
        "93. 2018, the Chief Engineer got re-verified from an independent authority by addressing to Superintendent Engineer, Karimnagar. In absence of any prescribed procedure for verification, it was fair on the part of the Chief Engineer to call for a report from an independent Superintending Engineer i.e. the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar. There is no definite procedure for verification in the event of any complaint filed by any of the bidders, as contemplated under clause",
        "94. 6 of the tender conditions. The Division Bench has committed an error, in recording a finding that, calling for a report from the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, by the Chief Engineer, is not in accordance with the procedure.",
        "95. Having regard to the nature of dispute, it was always open for the Chief Engineer to call for a report from an independent authority i.e. Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar. Such a procedure adopted by the Chief Engineer was fair and cannot be said to be either illegal or arbitrary. Such a report is made basis in the decision-making process, to open the bid of the appellant in Part-II.",
        "96. In the case of Tata Cellular v. Union of India 1994(6) SCC 651, while considering the scope of judicial review, in matters relating to Government contracts-tenders, this Court has held that the States decision/action must be in consonance of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The scope is confined to examine only the decision-making process and not the merits of the decision itself. It is specifically held that courts cannot sit as appellate court while exercising power of review in matters relating to contracts and tenders.",
        "97. In the case of Afcons Infrastructure Limited v. Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Limited and Another 2016(16) SCC 818, this Court found fault in the High Court, in interfering with the decision of the authority in a matter relating to contracts and tenders, without there being any mala fides or irrationality or perversity in the procedure adopted by the authorities.",
        "98. In the case of Consortium of Titagarh Firema Adler v. Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. 2017(7) SCC 486, while considering the scope of judicial review, in matters relating to power of contracts, this Court has held that exercise of power of judicial review is called for, if the approach is arbitrary or mala fide or procedure adopted is meant to favour someone.",
        "99. Further, in the case of Municipal Corporation, Ujjain and Anr. v. BVG India Ltd. & Ors. 2018(5) SCC 462, this Court has held that, while considering the scope of judicial review, in matters relating to contracts, it is held that the same is restricted to decision-making process but not the decision itself. It is held that the High Court cannot act as appellate court to review tender evaluation and set aside the award of tender.",
        "100. All the judgments referred above, support the case of the appellant, as much as, we are of the view that the procedure adopted by the tendering authority is fair, just and reasonable. In absence of any specific mala fides and grant of exemption from any essential conditions of tender, authorities have acted within their authority, as such, it cannot be construed either as a relaxation or violation of tender conditions.",
        "101. The learned senior counsel, Sri Basant, appearing for the fourth respondent/writ petitioner, has relied on the judgments in the case of Poddar Steel Corporation v. Ganesh Engineering Works (1991)3 SCC 273 , BSN Joshi & SWons Ltd. v. Nmair Coal Services Ltd. and Ors (2006)11 SCC 548 Bakshi Security and Personnel Services Pvt. Ltd. v. Devkishan Computed Private Limited and Ors.(2016)8 SCC 446 Central Coalfields Limited and others v. SLL-SML and others (2016)8 SCC 622 , in support of his arguments that the essential clauses of a tender should be enforced strictly and no deviation is permissible under law.",
        "102. We are of the view that the above said judgments have no application to the facts of this case, for the reason that, it is not a case of violation of any tender conditions. Further, pleading that no case is made out by the appellant for interference under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, learned counsel, in support of his argument, has relied on judgment in the case of Pritam Singh v. State AIR 1950 SC 169 ; Penu Balakrishna Iyer & Ors. v. Ariya M. Ramaswamy Iyer & Ors. AIR 1965 SC 195 ; Shaikh Ali Hossain & Ors. v. Shaikh Showkat Ali & Anr. (2008)8 SCC 180 .",
        "103. With reference to the same, it is to be noticed that the power conferred on this Court, under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, is the corrective jurisdiction to settle the law. Further, it is to be noticed that when the learned Single Judge of the High Court has found that the process of re-verification done by the Chief Engineer, on the dispute in question, is fair and acceptable for arriving at a decision, but the Division Bench has set aside such order, only on the ground that the report is called for from the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, who is not the concerned Engineer, as per the procedure. In absence of any prescribed procedure to deal with complaints, it was fair on the part of the Chief Engineer, in calling a report from the independent authority, other than the jurisdictional officers. As the issue does not relate to strict construction of territorial jurisdiction, it is always open for the decision-making authority, to have a report from the independent authority, to arrive at the just decision.",
        "104. Further, in the case of Management of Narendra & Company Pvt. Ltd. v. Workmen of Narendra & Company (2016) 3 SCC 340 , while considering the scope of the intra court appeal, this Court has held that, unless Appellate Bench concludes that findings of the learned Single Judge are perverse, it shall not disturb the same."
