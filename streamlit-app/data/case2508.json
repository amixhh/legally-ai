        "17. 87 granted by the trial court to that of Rs. 48,556/- with interest @ 6% from the date of filing of the suit till realization. Hence this appeal.",
        "18. We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and perused the impugned judgment and the material made available on record. Despite service of notice none appeared on behalf of the respondent company.",
        "19. Appearing on behalf of the appellant, Shri G.V. Chandrashekar, learned counsel submitted that the High Court has committed serious error in reducing the amount of damages without assigning any reason whatsoever. It was also submitted that the High Court was under an erroneous impression as if the appellant was seeking further enhancement of the claim and in the process made an observation commenting as if the appellant manipulated and altered the documentary evidence.",
        "20. It is to be noted that both the courts concurrently found that the insurance coverage was in respect of entire premises and machinery installed therein and the policy was alive and in force on the date of fire accident. The appellate court even rejected the submission of the respondent company that the appellant under document Exhibit D-5 agreed to receive a sum of Rs. 21,440/- only in full and final settlement of the claims. The appellate court in this regard came to the conclusion that there was no proof of full and final settlement of claims in terms of document Exhibit D-",

        "22. Damage to building.",

PW-2 Ramachandrappa, a building contractor has been examined who stated in the evidence that a sum of Rs. 30,000/- was spent for purchase of materials and a sum of Rs. 5,000/- was paid for labour charges towards the civil works of the building. The learned trial court upon appreciation of the evidence allowed only a sum of Rs. 5,000/- towards labour charges and the amount spent towards purchase of building materials was disallowed for want of proof. The learned appellate court construed the finding of the trial court as if the appellant firm preferred appeal in that regard and in the process came to the conclusion that there was no proof regarding the amount spent for purchase of materials. In fact, the trial court did not award any amount in that regard. The approach adopted by the appellate court is more or less similar in respect of all the issues.",
        "26. The appellate court went on upholding the findings recorded by the trial court which actually were not in favour of the appellant firm. The whole approach adopted by the High Court was as if the appellant firm preferred the first appeal without any merit whatsoever. The first appeal, in fact, was preferred by the respondent company.",
        "27. The appellate court having upheld and accepted the reasoning of the trial court without recording any reason whatsoever modified the amount of damages of Rs. 1,26,",
        "28. 87 awarded by the trial court to that of Rs. 48,556/-.",
        "29. A perusal of the trial court judgment discloses that it had not only taken note of oral evidence but of each and every document filed by the parties and recorded a specific finding in respect of each of the items. The trial court held that the appellant firm is not entitled to a sum of Rs.2,07,000/- out of the total claim of Rs. 3,33,",

        "36. 00Total: Rs.2,07,",
        "37. 00",
        "38. The reason adopted in disallowing the claims in respect of the items referred to herein above has been upheld by the High Court but without recording any reason further reduced the amount of damages granted by the trial court. There is no reason whatsoever based on which the High Court could have interfered with the well considered judgment of the trial court. It is clear that the trial court upon appreciation of evidence upheld the receipts in exhibit P-70, P-71, P-72, P-75, P-77, P-181 and P-",
        "39. The trial court also relied upon exhibit P-190 and P-",
        "40. The trial court relying upon exhibit P-190, exhibit P-188 and exhibit P-199 and for the detailed reasons had granted Rs. 5,000/-, Rs. 8,000/- and Rs. 5,000/- respectively under the said documents. Total amount thus comes to Rs. 1,26,",
        "41. The trial court after an elaborate consideration rightly deducted the claim in respect of item Nos. 71, 76, 77 and 78 and accordingly allowed only a sum of Rs. 1,26,",
        "42. 87 towards the damages. There is not a single reason in the judgment of the High court for reducing the quantum of damages awarded by the trial court."
