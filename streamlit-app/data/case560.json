No. 179 of 2001 seeking the discharge of the Official Liquidator, who was acting as the Provisional Liquidator of KOFL (Respondent No. 2 in the SLPs before us). This application was made on the ground that there were no other claims left to be settled against the company, and therefore, the services of the Official Liquidator were no longer required. The application was opposed by Respondent No. 1 on the ground that it would prejudice other creditors of the company and was a mala fide attempt by the Petitioner to grab the subject property. Meanwhile, the Official Liquidator filed a report on",

        "43. 2013, the learned Company Judge allowed the application and discharged the liquidator in view of the fact that unsecured creditors of KOFL had been settled. Further, given the lack of adequate advertising of the winding up petition, and the unwillingness of any other creditor or contributory of KOFL to prosecute the petition in terms of Rule 101 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 (hereinafter 1959 Rules), the original winding up petition, C.P. No. 179 of 2001, was dismissed. The Official Liquidator was directed to return investments worth Rs.",

        "45. 12 Soon after this order, one of the secured creditors of KOFL, State Bank of India (hereinafter SBI) approached the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Chennai (hereinafter DRT) for securing its interest and sought an injunction restraining the Official Liquidator from refunding the sum of Rs.",

        "49. 2017, a Division Bench of the High Court revived the winding up proceedings on the basis that it would be unjust and inequitable to wind up the company only for the reason that no other creditor or contributory was willing to prosecute the winding up petition. Taking note of the secured creditors of KOFL who had still not been satisfied and had consequently approached the DRT, C.P. No. 179 of 2001 was revived and the Official Liquidator was directed to continue the winding up proceedings under the supervision of the Company Judge. This order of the Division Bench in O.S.A. No. 396 of 2013 has been impugned in the aforementioned S.L.P. (Civil) No. 5143 of 2018 filed by the Petitioner before this Court.",
        "50. In view of this factual background, two issues arise for consideration before this Court: First, whether the winding up proceedings against KOFL should be revived. Second, in the event that the proceedings should be revived, can a sale deed be executed based on the agreement to sell dated",
        "51. 2000 entered into by the Petitioner and KOFL.",
        "52. Learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the winding up petition deserves to be dismissed, as all the creditors of KOFL have now been satisfied in accordance with the orders of the Company Judge and there are no other proceedings pending against KOFL before any fora. Further, since no creditor had challenged the order of the Company Court dismissing the winding up proceedings, it was submitted that the proceedings do not merit revival at this stage. As regards the execution of a sale deed, learned Senior Counsel refuted the finding that the agreement to sell amounts to a fraudulent preference. Relying on the provisions of Section 531 of the 1956 Act, he argued that the agreement to sell cannot be deemed as a fraudulent preference as the agreement to sell was not executed within the six-month period preceding the filing of the winding up petition. In addition to this, he also adverted to the lack of any fraudulent intention underlying the transaction and drew support from the No Objection Certificate issued by the Income Tax authorities to argue that the sale was not undervalued. Lastly, it was submitted that Section 293(1) of the 1956 Act is inapplicable to the present case, as the subject property does not form the whole or substantial whole of the property owned by KOFL. Thus, he stated that the approval of the Board of Directors vide resolution dated",
        "53. 1999 was sufficient, and no approval from the general meeting was required.",
        "54. Per contra, learned Counsel for Respondent No. 2 (Official Liquidator) submitted that the winding up proceedings were correctly revived, as there are several secured creditors of KOFL that have still not been satisfied. He also argued that the subject property is the only property of KOFL and cannot be transferred without the approval of the general meeting in terms of Section 293(1) of the 1956 Act. With respect to the agreement to sell, it was submitted that it is a fraudulent preference in favour of the Petitioner. To substantiate this, he relied on the provisions of the agreement which state that the remaining consideration of Rs.64 lakhs would be paid only at the time of registration of the property. In light of this, he submitted that the adjustment of the said amount was not contemplated in the agreement and by doing so, the clause itself has been rendered redundant.",
        "55. We have considered the arguments advanced by both sides and perused the material on record. Since the issue of fraudulent preference hinges on the survival of the winding up petition, we shall first proceed to examine whether the Division Bench was correct in reviving the winding up proceedings. Revival of the winding up petition",
        "56. From a bare perusal of the decision of the Division Bench, it is evident that the requirements governing the advertisement of winding up petitions under the 1959 Rules are crucial for the determination of this issue. It would therefore be useful to note the relevant rules, which are reproduced hereunder: R.",
        "57. Admission of petition and directions as to advertisement - Upon the filing of the petition, it shall be posted before the Judge in Chambers for admission of the petition and fixing a date for the hearing thereof and for directions as to the advertisements to be published and the persons, if any, upon whom copies of the petition are to be served. The Judge may, if he thinks fit, direct notice to be given to the company before giving directions as to the advertisement of the petition. R.99: Advertisement of petition - Subject to any directions of the Court, the petition shall be advertised within the time and in the manner provided by rule 24 of these rules. The advertisement shall be in Form No.",
        "58. R.24: Advertisement of petition - (1) Where any petition is required to be advertised, it shall, unless the Judge otherwise orders, or these rules otherwise provide, be advertised not less than fourteen days before the date fixed for hearing, in one issue of the Official Gazette of the State or the Union Territory concerned, and in one issue each of a daily newspaper in the English language and a daily newspaper in the regional language circulating in the State or the Union Territory concerned, as may be fixed by the Judge. R.101: Substitution of creditor or contributory for original petitioner - Where a petitioner – … (2) fails to advertise his petition within the time prescribed by these rules or by order of Court or such extended time as the Court may allow …(4) if appearing, does not apply for an order in terms of the prayer of his petition, or, where in the opinion of the Court there is other sufficient cause for an order being made under this rule, the Court may, upon such terms as it may think just, substitute as petitioner any creditor or contributory who, in the opinion of the Court, would have a right to present a petition, and who is desirous of prosecuting the petition.",
        "59. The above rules find mention in the part relating to winding up petitions under the 1959 Rules. They lay down the procedure for instituting a winding up action. From a reading of Rules 96, 99, and 24, it is clear that the advertisement of a winding up petition is mandatory. In the event that the petitioning creditor fails to advertise the petition within the prescribed time, Rule 101 accords the Court with the discretion to substitute such petitioning creditor with another creditor or contributory, if the latter is capable and desirous of prosecuting the winding up petition.",
        "60. In the instant case, while dealing with C.A. No. 734 of 2011 in C.P. No. 179 of 2001 seeking discharge of the Official Liquidator, the learned Company Judge observed that the mandatory procedure for advertising a winding petition, as stipulated under Rules 95, 96, 99, and 24 of the 1959 Rules had not been complied with. While looking into the implications of the failure to advertise, the learned Company Judge adverted to Rule 101, which allows for substitution of the petitioning creditor. However, since it was found that no other creditor had expressed the desire to prosecute the original petition, C.P. No. 179 of 2001 was dismissed. It was observed that such dismissal would not prejudice the creditors as more than 10,000 unsecured creditors of KOFL had been settled in the last 12 years after being given adequate notice, and even the secured creditors would not be prejudiced, as they would still be free to pursue their claims before the DRT.",
        "61. As noted supra, a Division Bench of the High Court set aside the order of the Company Court in appeal. While it was observed that the winding up petitions had not been advertised by the petitioning creditor in accordance with the 1959 Rules, it was held that it would be unjust and inequitable to wind up the company only for this reason, as there were several secured creditors (including SBI) who had still not been satisfied and had consequently approached the DRT. It was observed that before dismissing the winding up petition, all the secured creditors to whom KOFL owed money, should have been called by the Official Liquidator to inquire whether they wanted to step into the shoes of the original petitioner. Taking a broad interpretation of Rule 101, the Division Bench held that the Rule cannot be read as an absolute bar on the continuation of winding up proceedings, where the petitioning creditor fails to advertise the petition. Adverting to the inherent powers vested with the Company Court under Rule 9 and given the absence of a specific provision mandating that the advertisement shall only be published by the petitioning creditor, the Division Bench observed that the Company Court has the discretion to direct the provisional liquidator to publish the advertisement, where the situation so demands. In view of this, C.P. No. 179 of 2001 was revived and the Official Liquidator was directed to continue the winding up proceedings.",
        "62. Upon examining the relevant rules and the decisions rendered by the learned Company Judge and the Division Bench, we are inclined to agree with the view taken by the latter.",
        "63. 1 By order dated",
        "64. 2001, the learned Company Judge had directed the publication of C.P. No. 179 of 2001 in an English and Tamil daily as well as the Government Gazette. However, despite this order, no such advertisement was made. To this extent, we agree with the Division Bench that there has been a violation of the advertisement requirements under Rules 96, 99 and 24, which are mandatory in nature [see National Conduits (P) Ltd. v. S.S. Arora, AIR 1968 SC 279 ; Lt. Col. RK Saxena v. Imperial Forestry Corporation, 2001 CLC 1746].",
        "65. 2 Given this failure to advertise, the option of substitution provided in Rule 101 becomes relevant. In this respect, both the Courts below have found that no other creditor or contributory expressed willingness to prosecute the original winding up petition. At the same time, as noted by the Division Bench, there are other unsatisfied secured creditors of KOFL who were not given the option to step into the shoes of the petitioning creditor in terms of Rule",
        "66. 3 Against this backdrop, the crucial question that arises for our consideration is whether a winding up petition can be dismissed solely on the ground of lack of a prosecuting creditor under Rule 101, or whether the Company Court has the power to direct the publication of an advertisement by the Liquidator of the company, especially in cases where other unsatisfied creditors still remain. For answering this question, it is important to bear in mind that winding up proceedings are proceedings in rem and have an impact on the rights of people, in general. Thus, it is mandatory to advertise such proceedings, so as to ensure that they receive the widest possible publicity and all relevant stakeholders have adequate notice. This implies that in a situation where the petitioning creditor fails to advertise the petition and no other creditor or contributory comes forward to prosecute it, Rule 101 should not be read in a manner that absolutely bars the continuation of a winding up petition. This is particularly so when there are unsatisfied creditors who should have been given an opportunity to prosecute the petition, but were deprived of the same due to the failure to advertise. Indeed, Rule 101 is only limited to instances where the petitioning creditor fails to advertise the petition. However, there is nothing in the language of Rules 24, 96, or 99 to indicate that only such petitioning creditor can advertise the petition. In our considered opinion, given the absence of a specific provision mandating that the petition only be advertised by petitioning creditor, the Company Court has the discretion to direct the publishing of an advertisement to secure the interest of other creditors. In such situations, the winding up proceedings cannot be dismissed, as it would frustrate the very objective of securing the interest of all creditors.",
        "67. 4 In light of this discussion, we find that it would be unjust to dismiss the winding up petition in the instant case solely on the ground that there is no other person willing to substitute the original creditor in terms of Rule",
        "68. Here, due to the lack of adequate advertisement of the winding up petitions, it appears that the secured creditors of KOFL were constrained to approach the DRT for recovery of their dues by filing O.A. Nos. 139 of 2001, 978 of 2000; and 14 of",
        "69. Further, upon learning of the decision of the Company Judge dated",
        "70. 2013 dismissing the winding up petition, one of the secured creditors (SBI) also approached the DRT to secure its interest. Based on this, vide order dated",
        "71. 2013, the DRT had directed that the amount to be returned to KOFL be attached so that the banks have an opportunity to recover their dues from KOFL. This clearly goes on to show that the secured creditors of KOFL were relevant stakeholders who were affected by the non-advertising of the winding up petition. They should have been called upon to indicate whether they would want to step into the shoes of the petitioning creditors as per Rule",
        "72. 5 Clearly, the submission of the learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner that the winding up petition deserves to be dismissed as all creditors of KOFL have been satisfied is belied by the existence of the proceedings before the DRT. The records show that the settlement of dues has only been with respect to the unsecured creditors of KOFL, which was carried out pursuant to the orders issued by the Company Judge. This is supported by the fact that the advertisement dated",
        "73. 2005 issued by KOFL inviting claims from recoveries made by its Administrator, was only limited to the depositors or unsecured creditors of the company."
