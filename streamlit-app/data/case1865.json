        "22. 2015 did not agree with the order of the learned Single Judge striking down the adverse entry made in the Annual Confidential Report. The Division Bench held that the Governor alone has the power to pass an order of dismissal, removal or termination on the recommendation of the High Court which is made in exercise of powers of control vested in the High Court and that the High Court cannot dismiss, remove or terminate the services of the District Judge. It was further held that the notification Annexure P-16 has to be treated as recommendation of the High Court to the Governor for removal of services of the appellant and the Governor has to proceed and make necessary consequential order in accordance with the recommendations of the High Court. Accordingly the appeal was disposed of.",
        "23. Shri P.S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant submits that the Governor of the Himachal Pradesh is the appointing authority who alone could retire the appellant, that too in public interest after forming an opinion and after giving a notice of three months to the appellant and that the High Court is only recommending authority in that respect. The Governor has not passed an order retiring the appellant at the age of 58 years. The appellant has attained the age of superannuation on",

        "27. 2005, i.e. the last day of the month in which he attains the age of superannuation, i.e. 58 years. Therefore, it cannot be said that the appellant has retired on attaining the age of superannuation at 60 years.",
        "28. Having regard to the contentions urged, the only question for consideration is whether retiring the appellant retrospectively on completing the age of 58 years is justified in law.",
        "29. This Court in Registrar (Admn.), High Court of Orissa, Cuttack v. Sisir Kanta Satapathy (Dead) by LRs. and Anr. (1999) 7 SCC 725 , while considering the scope of Articles 233, 234 and 235 of the Constitution of India has held that the control vested in the High Court over the subordinate judiciary though absolute and exclusive, has to be exercised without usurping the power vested in the executive under the Constitution. The High Court retains the power of disciplinary control over the subordinate judiciary, including the power to initiate disciplinary proceedings, suspend them pending enquiry and impose punishment on them. But when it comes to the question of dismissal, removal, reduction in rank or termination of judicial officers on any count whatsoever, the High Court becomes only the recommending authority and cannot itself pass such an order. The High Court has to send its recommendations to the Governor because the Governor is the authority to dismiss, remove, reduce in rank or terminate the appointment.",
        "30. In the instant case, the appellant had not been retired by the appointing authority, namely, the Governor of Himachal Pradesh. Therefore, it cannot be said that the appellant had retired on the completion of age of 58 years. Instead of quashing the notification at Annexure P-16, the Division Bench treated the said notification as recommendation of the High Court to the Governor for removal of the services of the appellant. This order was passed after the appellant had completed the age of 60 years. In terms of the order of the Division Bench, the Governor has passed an order dated",
        "31. 2017 retrospectively retiring the appellant with effect from",
        "32. 2005, which, in our view, is not permissible in law. The Himachal Pradesh Judicial Service Rules, 2004 do not provide for retrospectively retiring the judicial officers. The order of the High Court retiring the appellant at the age of 58 years cannot take effect as it was without authority of law. It only means that the appellant has to be treated to have been retired from service on completion of 60 years of age on"
