        "45. 1993 and the seal of the Notary is also seen in the Power of Attorney.",
        "46. On behalf of the appellant, it was contended before the High Court that even assuming that the vakalatnama was filed on behalf of the appellant through Power of Attorney, Rule 79 of the Bombay High Court Rules requires personal service of the writ of summons on a defendant even if appearance was entered on his behalf by an advocate. To the said contention, the High Court opined that Rule 79 of the Bombay High Court Rules speaks of a waiver of the requirement of serving the writ of summons personally, if the advocate undertakes in writing to accept service of that writ of summons and to file a vakalatnama. The High Court pointed out that Rule 79 contemplates a stage before the vakalatnama is in fact filed and once the vakalatnama is filed, there is no question of having to serve a party personally thereafter. The High Court pointed out that in Suit No.2865 of 1994, vakalatnama was filed by the Power of Attorney in the suit itself and there is no question of having to thereafter serve a party personally. After referring to the affidavit in reply at pages 62 and 63 of the paper book, the High Court observed that summons was in fact served on the advocates for the appellant and respondent No.2 by bailiff attached to the office of Sherrif of Mumbai and there is an affidavit of service dated",
        "47. 1999 made by the bailiffs clerk to that effect. Observing that the Court has personally checked the original affidavit of the bailiff and the file and pointing out that there is no affidavit in rejoinder, the learned Single Judge has dismissed the Notice of Motion No.580 of",
        "48. According to the appellant, the High Court erred in holding that the Power of Attorney dated",
        "49. 1993 is genuine. It was urged that the alleged Power of Attorney is said to have been notarized at Mumbai before Advocate Raja who was representing respondent No.2 in the original suit whereas, the appellant company is located in Bangalore. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 has submitted that the appellant herein surrendered and/or sold all its rights and interest in the property in question to respondent No.2 on",
        "50. 1993 and the present appeal is a proxy litigation on behalf of respondent No.",
        "51. It is the contention of respondent No.1 that since K. Shrinivas Rao duly constituted the Power of Attorney of the appellant has filed his reply on",
        "52. 1994 and the said reply was filed through M/s. Narayanan & Narayanan, Advocates in which the appellant through the Power of Attorney has stated that the premises in question was acquired by the appellant with the contribution made by respondent No.2- M/s. Woodland Garden Cafe and therefore, respondent No.2 also should be heard before any order is passed in the suit. It was submitted that based on the reply affidavit filed by K. Shrinivas Rao, respondent No.1 filed application for amendment and the amendment application was allowed on",
        "53. 1994 and respondent No.2 was impleaded as defendant No.1A. It is therefore, submitted that filing of vakalatnama on behalf of the appellant by its duly constituted Power of Attorney K. Shrinivas Rao and subsequent impleading of respondent No.2 clearly shows that the appellant and respondent No.2 were duly served and participated in the proceedings and were aware of the decree dated",
        "54. It was contended that the appellant has not approached with the correct averments and in view of the incorrect stand taken by the appellant, the High Court rightly rejected the Notice of Motion refusing to set aside the ex-parte decree dated",
        "55. Though various contentions have been raised as to whether appellant was served or not and entered appearance in the suit, we are not inclined to go into the merits of the contentions. In our view, an opportunity has to be given to the appellant for contesting the suit. It is because the suit was filed for recovery of damages of Rs.1 crore and respondent No.1 claimed interest @ 24% per annum. By the judgment dated",
        "56. 2003, the Court has directed the appellant and respondent No.2 to pay a sum of Rs.77,02,500/- and Rs.42,70,",
        "57. 46, total amount payable under decree is Rs.1,20,03,",
        "58. The Court also directed the payment of subsequent interest @ 6% per annum on the said amount of Rs.77,02,500/- till date of reliasation.",
        "59. As pointed out earlier, the suit claim was for damages. The damages to the property if any, can be ascertained only after the parties adduce the oral and documentary evidence. We have no reason to believe that the appellant would have benefitted by deliberately not contesting the suit as they would in any event be saddled with interest if their conduct was to drag and prolong the suit. Considering the nature of the claim and other facts and circumstances and in the interest of justice, we are of a view that an opportunity has to be given to the appellant to contest the suit subject to terms. The appellant has also in that regard shown its bona fide by depositing Rs.60,00,000/- in compliance of the order dated",
        "60. By the order dated",
        "61. 2020, we have also directed the appellant to deposit further sum of Rs.35,00,000/- for which the appellant sought for some more time for compliance."
