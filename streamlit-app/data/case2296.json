        "17. 1996 governing the habitual offenders/ potential habitual offenders. He contended before the Tribunal that he was entitled for a second warning before an order of discharge could have been passed against him in accordance with the Policy. The Tribunal accepted the submission made by the Respondent and allowed the application. The order of discharge was set aside. The Respondent was held to be entitled to all consequential benefits, including back wages which were restricted to 25 per cent. The Review Application filed by the Appellant was rejected by the Tribunal.",
        "18. The only point that arises for our consideration in the present case is the interpretation of the Policy dealing with habitual offenders. The Air Force Policy dated",
        "19. 1996 was issued by the Air Force Headquarters, prescribing the procedure to be followed while processing the cases of habitual offenders. According to the Policy, an Airman is entitled to be issued a precautionary warning (being a habitual offender). The Airman has to be informed that he would be getting another opportunity to mend himself and any addition of another punishment entry, either Red or Black, would result in his discharge from the service. Para 2 (b) of the Policy provides that whenever the case of an Airman is considered by the competent authority for final orders and he is afforded one more chance, a warning letter is required to be issued to him by his Commanding Officer again. The said warning letter shall be treated as a second time warning. Para 3 of the Policy postulates that habitual offenders shall be served with a show cause notice calling upon them to explain the reasons as to why the proposed action of discharge from service shall not be taken against them. The habitual offenders are entitled for an opportunity to submit their explanation before an order of discharge is passed.",
        "20. The Tribunal was of the opinion that the Respondent was given only one warning. As the second warning which is mandatory according to the Policy was not given to the Respondent, the Tribunal was of the view that the order of discharge was vitiated. The Tribunal failed to take into account the fact that para 2 (b) provides for a second warning only when the competent authority considers issuance of final orders but is also of the opinion that another chance should be given to the Airman. The requirement of the second warning letter would be only in such circumstances.",
        "21. The Respondent was initially a potential habitual offender before he was considered as a habitual offender. He was entitled for a warning to be issued in",
        "22. Admittedly, there was a delay in issuance of the warning letter. Ultimately, the warning letter was issued on",
        "23. The Respondent did not mend himself for which reason a show cause notice was issued to him. Even in the explanation to the show cause notice, the Respondent did not dispute the allegations of misconduct made against him. He, in fact, admitted to having indulged in acts of indiscipline and sought for another opportunity to correct himself. The show cause notice issued to the Respondent is in accordance with the Habitual Offenders Policy. A second warning letter is not required when it is decided to pass a final order without giving another chance. There is no violation of the procedure prescribed by the Policy dated"
