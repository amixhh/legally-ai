        "168. 1975 and request of the plaintiff to allot entire",
        "169. 61 acres of land was not acceded to and only 24 acres of land was allotted possession of which was handed over to the plaintiff on",
        "170. There being no allotment of rest",
        "171. 61 acres of land prior to",
        "172. 1983 on the basis of earlier decision no allotment would have been made after the enforcement of the Rules in disregard to the statutory Rules. The statutory Rules enforced w.e.f",
        "173. 1983 substantially changed the manner of allotment and more rigorous conditions were put on the land of the Trust. There cannot be any dispute with the proposition that after the land is acquired for public purpose it vests in the acquiring body and the land holder has no right to claim the land acquired. In this context reference has been made to State of Kerala and others vs. M. Bhaskar Pillai and another, (1997) 5 SCC",
        "174. In paragraph 4 following has been laid down:?",
        "175. In view of the admitted position that the land in question was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by operation of Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, it stood vested in the State free from all encumbrances. The question emerges: whether the Government can assign the land to the erstwhile owners? It is settled law that if the land is acquired for a public purpose, after the public purpose was achieved, the rest of the land could be used for any other public purpose. In case there is no other public purpose for which the land is needed, then instead of disposal by way of sale to the erstwhile owner, the land should be put to public auction and the amount fetched in the public auction can be better utilised for the public purpose envisaged in the Directive Principles of the Constitution. In the present case, what we find is that the executive order is not in consonance with the provision of the Act and is, therefore, invalid. Under these circumstances, the Division Bench is well justified in declaring the executive order as invalid. Whatever assignment is made, should be for a public purpose. Otherwise, the land of the Government should be sold only through the public auctions so that the public also gets benefited by getting higher value. ?",
        "176. This Court again in Sulochana Chandrakant Galande vs. Pune Municipal Transport and others, (2010) 8 SCC 467 , held that after vesting of land in State free from all encumbrances after acquisition, landowner becomes persona non grata after vesting and has right to compensation only and cannot claim right of restoration of land on any ground, whatsoever. In paragraph 22 following has been laid down:?",
        "177. In view of the above, the law can be summarised that once the land is acquired, it vests in the State free from all encumbrances. It is not the concern of the land owner how his land is used and whether the land is being used for the purpose for which it was acquired or for any other purpose. He becomes persona non grata once the land vests in the State. He has a right to get compensation only for the same. The person interested cannot claim the right of restoration of land on any ground, whatsoever. ?",
        "178. The plaintiffs case at the highest is that her application for allotment of",
        "179. 61 acres of land was pending consideration when Rules, 1983 were enforced. The plaintiffs own case is that refusal to allot",
        "180. 61 acres of land took place only on",
        "181. 1989 when the Trust executed lease of 24 acres of land only. Thus, at best the application for re-allotment of",
        "182. 61 acres of land was pending at the time when new Rules came in force. New Rules, thus, were fully attracted for any further disposal of land by the Trust as per Rule 5 and as per sub-Rule (2) of Rule 5 the land would have been disposed of except as otherwise provided in sub-Rule (1) only by holding public auction; inviting tenders by public advertisement; making offers to or accepting offers from any Government, Local Authority, Public Sector Undertaking or a body corporate which is owned or controlled by Government; inviting applications from persons or bodies of persons who are eligible for allotment of plots under Rule 4, by public advertisement and land for public amenities such as for primary school, vehicle stand, public latrine or urinal, public library, reading room, hospital, dispensary or such other purpose, etc. Plaintiffs claim is not covered in any manner of disposal under Rule 5(2), hence no decree would have been passed by the trial court contrary to the statutory Rules as envisaged by Rule 5(2). The view of the High Court that Rules, 1983 are prospective and shall not effect the allotment made in favour of the plaintiff on",
        "183. 1975 and",
        "184. 1975 was erroneous. As observed above the allotments which were finalised in pursuance of Resolution dated",
        "185. 1975 and",
        "186. 1975 were saved, but allotment of any land which could not take place finally before enforcement of Rules, 1983 has to be in accordance with the Rules,",
        "187. In this context, reference is made to the judgment of this Court in State of Tamil Nadu vs. M/s. Hind Stone and others, (1981) 2 SCC",
        "188. In that case, the applications by various persons desirous of taking mining lease were pending when the Rules for grant of lease were amended. The Rules were amended on",
        "189. 1977 by introducing Rule 8-C, it was contended by several applicants that Rule 8-C was not applicable to the applicants whose applications were pending. The relevant facts were mentioned in paragraph 4 which are to the following effect:?",
        "190. Several persons who held leases for quarrying black granite belonging to the State Government and whose leases were about to expire, applied to the Government of Tamil Nadu for renewal of their leases. In some of the cases applications were made long prior to the date of G.O. Ms. No. 1312 by which Rule 8C was introduced. Some applications were made after Rule 8C came into force. There were also some applications for the grant of fresh leases for quarrying black granite. All the applications were dealt with after Rule 8C came into force and all of them were rejected in view of Rule 8C Several Writ Petitions were filed in the High Court questioning the vires of Rule 8C on various grounds. Apart from canvassing the vires of Rule 8C, it was contended that Rule 8C did not apply to grant of renewals of lease at all. It was also argued that in any event, in those cases in which the applications for renewal had been made prior to the coming into force of Rule 8C, their applications should have been dealt with without reference to Rule 8C. The Madras High Court while not accepting some of the contentions raised on behalf of the applicants, struck down Rule 8C on the ground that it exceeded the rule making power given to the State Government under Section 15 which, it was said, was only to regulate and not to prohibit the grant of mining leases. As a consequence all the applications were directed to be disposed of without reference to Rule 8C. It was also observed that even if Rule 8C was valid it applied only to the grant of fresh leases and not to renewals. It was also held that it was not open to the Government to keep the applications pending for a long time and then to dispose them of on the basis of a rule which had come into force later. The State Government has come in appeal against the judgment of the Madras High Court while the respondent-applicants have tried to sustain the judgment of the Madras High Court on grounds which were decided against them by the Madras High Court. ?",
        "191. Rejecting the argument that Rule 8-C is not attracted on the applications which were pending on date of amendment, it was held that applications were required to be disposed of on the basis of the Rules in force at the time of the disposal of the applications. Following was laid down in paragraph 13: \"",
        "192. Another submission of the learned Counsel in connection with the consideration of applications for renewal was that applications made sixty days or more before the date of G.O. Ms. No. 1312 (December 2, 1977) should be dealt with as if Rule 8C had not come into force. It was also contended that even applications for grant of leases made long before the date of G.O. Ms. No. 1312 should be dealt with as if Rule 8C had not come into force. The submission was that it was not open to the Government to keep applications for the grant of leases and applications for renewal pending for a long time and then to reject them on the basis of Rule 8C notwithstanding the fact that the applications had been made long prior to the date on which Rule 8C came into force. While it is true that such applications should be dealt with within a reasonable time, it cannot on that account be said that the right to have an application disposed of in a reasonable time clothes an applicant for a lease with a right to have the application disposed of on the basis of the rules in force at the time of the making of the application. No one has a vested right to the grant or renewal of a lease and none can claim a vested right to have an application for the grant or renewal of a lease dealt with in a particular way, by applying particular provisions. In the absence of any vested rights in anyone, an application for a lease has necessarily to be dealt with according to the rules in force on the date of the disposal of the application despite the fact that there is a long delay since the making of the application. We are, therefore, unable to accept the submission of the learned Counsel that applications for the grant or renewal of leases made long prior to the date of G.O. Ms. No. 1312 should be dealt with as if Rule 8-C did not exist. ?",
        "193. We, thus, are of the considered opinion that the claim of plaintiff for allotment of additional land of",
        "194. 61 acres which can be at best said to be pending on the date of enforcement of Rules, 1983 would have been only dealt with in accordance with Rule 5 of Rules, 1983 and disregard of said Rules the trial court would not have decreed the suit directing the Trust to execute lease in favour of the plaintiff of",
        "195. 61 acres of land. The decree of the trial court was clearly in the teeth of the statutory Rules and the High Court committed error in taking the view that Rules, 1983 were not applicable in the present case.",
        "196. It is also relevant to notice that lower Appellate Court has held that suit of the plaintiff was barred by time it having been filed more than three years after the refusal to allot the land. The High Court has held that the Appellate Court has committed error of law in considering the issue of limitation which was not the question raised before the trial court. In paragraph 17 of the judgment following has been held: \"",
        "197. Though the allotment of",
        "198. 61 acres of land was on",
        "199. 1975, the lease-deed in respect of 24 acres of land was executed on",
        "200. Thus, there was refusal on",
        "201. 1989 to execute the lease-deed in respect of",
        "202. 61 acres of land. Hence, the cause of action in terms of Article 54 of the Limitation Act would start running from",
        "203. 1989 when the defendant-NIT refused to execute the lease-deed. The suit in question having filed on",
        "204. 1989 was not, therefore, barred by the law of limitation. In fact, this was not the question raised before the trial court and no issue was framed in respect of it. The lower Appellate Court has committed an error of law in considering such issue and holding that the suit in question was barred by the law of limitation. The finding of the lower Appellant Court, therefore, needs to be set aside.?",
        "205. In so far as view of the High Court that Appellate Court committed error in entertaining the question of limitation which was not the issue framed by the trial court, suffice is to refer the provision of Section 3 of the Limitation Act,",
        "206. Section 3(1) of the Limitation Act provides as follows:?Section",
        "207. Bar of limitation.-(1) Subject to the provisions contained in sections 4 to 24(inclusive), every suit instituted, appeal preferred, and application made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed, although limitation has not been set up as a defence.?",
        "208. This Court in Foreshore Cooperative Housing Society Limited vs. Praveen D. Desai(dead) through Legal Representatives and others, (2015) 6 SCC 412 , had considered the question of jurisdiction of Court in reference to provisions of Limitation Act. Noticing Section 3 of the Act following was observed:?",
        "209. Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963 clearly provides that every suit instituted, appeal preferred and application made after the prescribed period of limitation, subject to the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24, shall be dismissed although the limitation has not been set up as a defence.",
        "210. A Constitution Bench of five Judges of this Court in the case of Pandurang Dhondi Chougule v. Maruti Hari Jadhav, AIR 1966 SC 153 , while dealing with the question of jurisdiction, observed that a plea of limitation or plea of res judicata is a plea of law which concerns the jurisdiction of the court which tries the proceeding. The Bench held(AIR p.155, para 10):",
        "211. The provisions of Section 115 of the Code have been examined by judicial decisions on several occasions. While exercising its jurisdiction Under Section 115, it is not competent to the High Court to correct errors of fact however gross they may, or even errors of law, unless the said errors have relation to the jurisdiction of the court to try the dispute itself. As Clauses (a), (b) and (e) of Section 115 indicate, it is only in cases where the subordinate court has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or has acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity that the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court can be properly invoked. It is conceivable that points of law may arise in proceedings instituted before subordinate courts which are related to questions of jurisdiction. It is well settled that a plea of limitation or a plea of res judicata is a plea of law which concerns the jurisdiction of the court which tries the proceedings. A finding on these pleas in favour of the party raising them would oust the jurisdiction of the court, and so, an erroneous decision on these pleas can be said to be concerned with questions of jurisdiction which fall within the purview of Section 115 of the Code. But an erroneous decision on a question of law reached by the subordinate court which has no relation to questions of jurisdiction of that court, cannot be corrected by the High Court Under Section",
        "212. ?",
        "213. No error was committed by the Appellate Court in entering into the issue as to whether application was barred by time. The Appellate Court was well within its jurisdiction in considering the question of limitation. We, however, for the present case need not express any opinion with regard to the question of limitation in view of we having held that plaintiff was not entitled for the decree. Thus, even without entering into the question of limitation we are of the clear opinion that plaintiff was not entitled for the decree as has been granted by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court."
