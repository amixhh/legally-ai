Their evidence would further show that Iqbal had friends on the way from Kannamvar Nagar to Swami Narayan Nagar.

        "81. The evaluation of evidence would show that on 11th January 2012, the statement of P.W.4 – Hasina Shaikh was recorded between",
        "82. 30 am to",
        "83. 30 am and the FIR was lodged by P.W.1 – Joshi at",
        "84. 35 pm, wherein he has taken upon himself the onus of being the first informant when more than 3 family members were available. In fact, P.W.1 had inquired into A.D. No.5 of",
        "85. It is not known as to when P.W.4 had raised suspicion against the present appellants. Moreover, she had suspected Shiva, Phulchand and Tevar besides Shrinivas as probable assailants of her son. She had not even suspected Vyankatesh at that stage.",
        "86. P.W.8 – Shyam Shinde also claims to have seen Iqbal in the company of Kunal and Vyankatesh at Firoz Shah Nagar Compound at",
        "87. 30 pm. The watchman of Godrej ground had given the cell phone of deceased to P.W.",
        "88. The watchman i.e. Mr. Rane was dropped by the prosecution. In fact, Mr. Rane would have been able to clarify as to who accompanied Iqbal after he had handed over the cell phone to him. The cell phone was handed over to the maternal uncle of the deceased on the very next day and it is surprising that the family members who were searching for Iqbal had not inquired with Mr. Rane. Handing over of the cell phone by the deceased to Mr. Rane is clothed with suspicion.",
        "89. This is a case of circumstantial evidence. The learned Sessions Judge has convicted the accused mainly on the basis of the evidence of last seen together and has relied upon the substantive evidence of P.W.10 – Kunal Gaikwad. The learned Sessions Judge has fallen in error to hold that the accused have not brought on record nor explained when they departed from the company of deceased Iqbal and thereafter, who was in the company of deceased Iqbal @ Gullu. It is a settled position of law that it is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove its own cause beyond reasonable doubt.",
        "90. In the case of Nizam & Anr. vs. State of Rajasthan (2016) 1 SCC 550 , the Apex Court has held as under :-",
        "91. Courts below convicted the appellants on the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 that deceased was last seen alive with the appellants on",
        "92. Undoubtedly, last seen theory is an important link in the chain of circumstances that would point towards the guilt of the accused with some certainty. The last seen theory holds the courts to shift the burden of proof to the accused and the accused to offer a reasonable explanation as to the cause of death of the deceased. It is well-settled by this Court that it is not prudent to base the conviction solely on last seen theory. Last seen theory should be applied taking into consideration the case of the prosecution in its entirety and keeping in mind the circumstances that precede and follow the point of being so last seen.",
        "93. Ordinarily, if the prosecution would succeed in establishing the theory that the accused and the deceased were last seen in the company of each other the failure of the accused to satisfactorily account for the disappearance of the deceased would be an incriminating circumstance but it cannot be a conclusive proof unless there is evidence on record to show that during the intervening time i.e. the time between last seen and the time when dead body is found the deceased had no occasion to meet anyone else. In fact, according to P.W.7, the deceased knew certain people on the way from Kannamvar Nagar to Swaminarayan Nagar. According to P.W.10, deceased had continued to be in his company whereas, Vyankatesh had parted their company at Panther Nagar ground itself.",
        "94. There is also evidence that the deceased was on inimical terms with several people. The distance between the place where the accused and deceased were last seen is about 10-12 kilometers from the place where the dead body was found. It is a settled position of law that it is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Only if the prosecution had discharged this onus of proving that the accused were last seen in the company of the deceased, the onus would shift upon them.",
        "95. In the case of Mohibir Rahman And Anr vs. State o f Assam reported in AIR 2002 SC 3064 , the Apex court has held as under :- The circumstance of last seen together does not by itself and necessarily lead to the inference that it was the accused who committed the crime. There must be something more establishing connectivity between the accused and the crime. There may be cases where on account of close proximity of place and time between the event of the accused having been last seen with the deceased and the factum of death a rational mind may be persuaded to reach an irresistible conclusion that either the accused should explain how and in what circumstances the victim suffered the death or should own the liability for the culpable homicide. In the present case there is no such proximity of time and place. As already noted the dead body has been recovered about 14 days after the date on which the deceased was last seen in the company of accused. The distance between the two places is about 30-40 Kms. The event of two accused persons having departed with the deceased and thus last seen together (by Lilima Rajbongshi, PW6) does not bear such close proximity with the death of victim by reference to time or place.",
        "96. None of the witnesses had named the present appellants as suspects from",
        "97. 00 pm of 9th January 2012 to",
        "98. 30 pm of 11th January 2012 despite their claim to have seen the deceased in the company of accused on 8th January 2012 as late as",
        "99. 30 pm. The brother of the deceased P.W.3 also has not suspected the accused and therefore, FIR was lodged against unknown persons by P.W.",
        "100. In the case of Bodhraj @ Bodha & Ors. Vs. State of Jammu & Kashmir (2002) 8 SCC 45 , the Apex Court has held as under :- The last-seen theory comes into play where the time-gap between the point of time when the accused and the deceased were seen last alive and when the deceased is found dead is so small that possibility of any person other than the accused being the author of the crime becomes impossible. It would be difficult in some cases to positively establish that the deceased was last seen with the accused when there is a long gap and possibility of other persons coming in between exists. In the absence of any other positive evidence to conclude that the accused and the deceased were last seen together, it would be hazardous to come to a conclusion of guilt in those cases.",
        "101. The learned counsel for the appellants has vehemently argued that there is no iota of evidence to connect the appellants with the homicidal death of deceased Iqbal. It is argued that a quarrel had taken place between the accused Shrinivas and deceased sometime in September/ October and the incident is of January. The date of death is not proximate to the date of previous quarrel and moreover, no untoward incident had occurred in three months prior to the incident. It is also argued that there is no evidence against Vyankatesh except that the witnesses have stated that the deceased had met Vyankatesh on the ground at Panther Nagar and had departed at Panther Nagar itself. It is also urged that all witnesses are interested witnesses.",
        "102. Per contra, the learned APP supports the case of the prosecution and submits that the accused has failed to furnish any explanation in his statement under section 313 of the Cr.P.C. to discredit the witnesses who have lastly seen the accused in the company of the deceased. The said submission cannot be comprehended in view of the fact that the prosecution itself has not established the theory of last seen together",
        "103. In the case of State of Karnataka Vs. Chand Basha (2016) 1 SCC 501 , the Apex Court has held as under :- The prosecution story relies upon the last seen together theory, which resulted into the death of Ganesh. This Court has time and again laid down the ingredients to be made out by the prosecution to prove the last seen together theory. The Court for the purpose of arriving at a finding as to whether the said offence has been committed or not, may take into consideration the circumstantial evidence. However, while doing so, it must be borne in mind that close proximity between the last seen evidence and death should be clearly established. Yet, the prosecution has failed to prove the evidence which establishes the last seen together theory beyond reasonable doubt to prove the guilt of the accused. The prosecution merely proved the motive which could have compelled the accused, and that the accused went to the bar with one other person, but the identity of that other person is not clearly established at all. The post-mortem report fails to specify any approximate time of death and in light of the recovery of the dead body on",
        "104. 2001, after 4 days, which is not a small gap since the deceased disappeared on",
        "105. 2001, it is not appropriate to convict the accused when his role is not firmly established.",
        "106. The recovery of rope at the instance of accused Shrinivas is vague and ambiguous since two ropes are placed on record. The rope was recovered from the place where the dead body was found - in an open place accessible to all. The recovery of cell phone does not lead to any logical conclusion as IMEI number in the panchanama differs from that of the IMEI number of cell phone. Moreover, the cell phone of the deceased was handed over by the deceased to Mr. Rane – P.W.11 and the same was returned to the maternal uncle of the deceased. There is no cogent evidence to show that the deceased had any other cell phone which was taken by the accused Shrinivas."
