        "3. The Respondent-contemnors in these applications made the following prayer: \"extend the operation of the said order of this Honble Court dated 1st August, 2014 by a further period of 15 working days\";",
        "4. Mr. S. Ganesh, learned senior Counsel appearing for the contemnors submits that substantial progress has been made by the contemnors-applicants in these applications in finding a suitable buyers for the three off-shore properties and also arranging a Bank guarantee for a sum of L 5,000 crores. He submits that negotiations for sale and for finalising the guarantee etc. are now at a critical stage, made possible only because this Court had permitted the contemnors-applicants to avail of the facility of video conferencing within the Tihar Jail complex. He submits that given 15 working days extension in the arrangement already made by us in terms of our order dated",
        "5. 2014 the contemnors should be in a position to complete the process of negotiations not only in relation to sale of the three off-shore hotel properties but also in relation to provision for a Bank guarantee for the required amount of L 5,000 crores. It is also submitted that the negotiations are in progress in relation to Amby Valley property to raise further funds to comply with the directions of this Court.",
        "6. Learned Counsel for the Respondents submit that although there is nothing on record apart from an assertion in the application and an affidavit in support thereof, to suggest that any negotiations have been conducted or that the negotiations have reached any meaningful stage between the sellers and the purchasers yet this Court could extend the facility already given to the contemnors subject to the condition that the contemnors do not ask for any further extension.",
        "7. In the circumstances and in view of the submissions made at the Bar we extend the operation of our earlier order dated",
        "8. 2014 for a further period of 15 working days only commencing",
        "9. We make it clear that we will not be inclined to grant any further extension and the contemnors would do well to finalise the on-going negotiations within the extended period. These I.As. are disposed of with the above directions. Order Dated",
        "10. 2014 (HONBLE MR. JUSTICE T.S. THAKUR HONBLE MR. JUSTICE ANIL R. DAVE HONBLE MR. JUSTICE ARJAN KUMAR SIKRI)",
        "11. Heard. We had by order dated 14th August, 2014 extended the operation of our earlier order dated 1st August, 2014 for a period of fifteen working days commencing",
        "12. 2014, making it clear that we would not be inclined to grant any further extension of time for the contemnors to finalise the on-going negotiations with prospective buyers of properties, within India and outside the country. The contemnors have now filed the present applications (I.A. Nos. 19-21 of 2014) seeking a further extension of the arrangement made by us by another fifteen more working days. The applications inter alia point out that a deal for sale of the three off-shore properties has been almost finalised by the contemnors and even a memorandum of Master Agreement executed between a foreign purchaser. While the deal had yet to be clinched and acted upon, adverse reports, appearing in United States print and electronic media, led to a panic situation in which the purchaser of the off-shore properties expressed their hesitation in finalising the deal. The contemnors assert that they have somehow persuaded the foreign purchaser to hold on and let the protests against the proposed sale of the assets to cool down and that the foreign purchaser has agreed to do so.",
        "13. Appearing for the applicants, Mr. S. Ganesh, learned senior counsel, submitted that given fifteen working days to negotiate the sale of off-shore properties they shall finalise the deal with the party concerned or with any other party, willing to purchase the same. Mr. Ganesh also points out that the contemnors are simultaneously making efforts to sell the remaining eight properties situate within the country through property agents/brokers/real-estate developers and that notwithstanding the slumps in the real-estate market expect to finalise such deals within the extended period.",
        "14. Since the applications filed by the contemnors did not carry any documentary material suggesting that any deal had been finalised with anyone interested in purchasing the off-shore properties, we asked Mr. Ganesh whether he could make good that statement by reference to any document. Mr. Ganesh has, in response, filed before us a copy of the in principle Master Agreement as also copies of certain press clippings which suggest that there were some demonstrations against the proposed sale of the properties in-question to a particular entity, owned by a sovereign nation. A perusal of these documents does prima facie suggest that an attempt has been indeed made to finalise the deal and also that some protests have been raised on account of the proposed sale of the assets to that particular entity. At the request of Mr. Ganesh, we direct that the copies of the in principle Master Agreement and the documents enclosed therewith including the press clippings be taken on record but kept in a sealed cover to maintain confidentiality in regard to the proposed transactions. Having said so, we are of the view that a prayer for extension of another fifteen working days further time to finalise the sale of the assets deserves to be granted. We must mention to the credit of Mr. Arvind P. Datar, learned senior counsel appearing for SEBI, say that even he did not in principle contest the prayer for an extension of time but only urged that the contemnors should finalise the deal as expeditiously as possible particularly when a large amount remains to be recovered from them, which will also have to be arranged after the conditions of bail are satisfied by the contemnors.",
        "15. Mr. Ganesh in reply submitted that given fifteen working days further time, the contemnors would not ask for any further extension. That statement is accepted."
