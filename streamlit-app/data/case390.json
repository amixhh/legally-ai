    "Input": [
        "1. R. Banumathi, J.",
        "2. Leave granted.",
        "3. This appeal arises out of the order passed by the High Court of Bombay in Writ Petition No.3646 of 2001 dated",
        "4. 2014, in and by which, the High Court enhanced the retrenchment compensation of Rs.6,049/- awarded by the Labour Court to Rs. 1,00,000/- without any interest.",
        "5. A charge-sheet dated",
        "6. 1988 was issued to the appellant for committing the misconduct of slapping his colleague, Mr. Kunjumon who was working with the respondent-company. An enquiry was conducted against the appellant and the services of the appellant were terminated on",
        "7. The appellant challenged his termination and a reference was made to the Labour Court, Pune. By the award dated",
        "8. 2000, Labour Court held that the enquiry against the appellant was fair and proper and the misconduct was proved. However, the Labour Court held that the punishment of dismissal from service was shockingly disproportionate and awarded retrenchment compensation of Rs.6,049/- to the appellant. Being aggrieved, the appellant filed writ petition contending that the punishment of dismissal was harsh and that the retrenchment compensation of Rs. 6,049/- awarded was no compensation at all. By the impugned judgment, the High Court while upholding the punishment of dismissal, enhanced the compensation to Rs.1,00,000/- minus Rs.6,049/- which was already paid to the appellant. Still aggrieved, the appellant has preferred this appeal.",
        "9. We have heard Mr. S. Ravi Shankar, the learned counsel for the appellant and the Learned Senior Counsel Mr. C.U. Singh, appearing for the respondent-management and perused the impugned judgment and material on record.",
        "10. The short question is whether the compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- awarded by the High Court is to be enhanced. Appellant who was an ex-serviceman was employed with the respondent-company as a Turner in the Auto Division w.e.f.",
        "11. 1978 drawing monthly wage of Rs.2,621/- and he worked till he was terminated on",
        "12. It is seen from the record that Mr. Kunjumon used harsh words and shoved the appellant towards the door and evidence would show that it was not a premeditated attack on Mr. Kunjumon. Both the Labour Court as well as the High Court recorded concurrent findings of fact that the misconduct of the appellant was proved on the basis of the evidence and that the punishment of dismissal was shockingly disproportionate. When the Labour Court passed the award, the appellant was about 59 years and he attained the age of superannuation in the year",
        "13. Considering the number of years which the appellant worked with the respondent and the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the interest of justice would be met if the compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- is enhanced to Rs.5,00,000/- which is inclusive of the compensation awarded by the High Court."
