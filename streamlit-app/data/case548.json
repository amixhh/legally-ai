        "27. 2021 that he has been forced by the representatives of the two opposite parties to sign on blank papers and threatening visits were made to his residence by the representatives to force him into a settlement, the impugned orders have been passed by the National Commission by observing as under in the order dated",
        "28. 2021:- The allegations, as have been made by the complainant, are of serious nature and may have grave implications. This Commission is a lawfully created tribunal in order to adjudicate upon the issues relating to consumer disputes and arrive at just conclusions. Anybody and everybody who feels aggrieved and for whom redress may be provided under the Act can approach this Commission invoking its jurisdiction as provided by law. Free access and unfettered right to approach, as permissible by law, is inbuilt in the system where rule of law prevails. Any attempt to impede such a course, not to speak of exercising coercion against anybody, cannot be rightly taken or be countenanced with. The matter requires explanation forthwith.",

        "30. 2021 and",
        "31. 2021 and by the order dated",
        "32. 2021, bailable warrants have been issued against him by further directing that he may be produced before the National Commission on",
        "33. However, it is required to be noted that all throughout the representatives of original opposite party No.2 company and their counsel remained present before the National Commission. It is true that if the allegations made by the original complainant recorded in the order dated",
        "34. 2021 to pressurize him and giving threats to enter into settlement are found to be true, the same are very serious and can be said to be interfering in the administration of justice. However, at the same time, the allegations are yet to be considered in detail by the National Commission after giving an opportunity to the opposite parties. The opposite parties are represented through their counsel and even through their authorised representatives, who remained present before the National Commission. It is also required to be noted that even as per the allegations made by the complainant recorded in the order dated",
        "35. 2021, the representatives of the opposite companies gave threats and forced him to enter into settlement and there were no specific allegations against the Director of original opposite party No.2 – Shri Dinanath Mohandas Dubhashi. Be that it may, even the review application against the order dated",
        "36. 2021 is pending before the Tribunal. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, issuance of the bailable warrants against Shri Dinanath Mohandas Dubhashi, the Director of original opposite party No.2 was not warranted at this stage. Bailable warrants are to be issued as a last resort and only in a case where it is found that the opponent parties are not cooperating at all and that they are avoiding appearance before the National Commission deliberately and/or they are not represented at all either through their authorised representative or through their counsel. In the present case, the allegations made by the original complainant recorded in the order dated",
        "37. 2021 are yet to be considered in detail by the National Commission after giving opportunity to both the opposite parties. The opposite parties are represented through their counsel and the authorised representatives and even the Director of the original opposite party No.1 company has always remained present in person before the National Commission through video conferencing as directed. Therefore, issuance of bailable warrants and the directions issued by the National Commission directing Shri Dinanath Mohandas Dubhashi, Director of original opposite party No.2 company to be produced, was not warranted at all at this stage. If at all subsequently, it is found that anybody has tried to pressurize the original complainant and pressurized him to enter into settlement and any threatening visits were made to the residence of the original complainant, further order can be passed by the National Commission. It cannot be disputed that free access and unfettered right to approach/justice, as permissible by law, is inbuilt in our judicial system where rule of law prevails. Any attempt to impede or obstruct the course of justice, not to speak of exercising any coercion against anybody, who is before the court or authority in order to seek justice, cannot be lightly taken or be countenanced with. However, at the same time, the case of the complainant is yet to be adjudicated upon and/or established and proved and the opportunities are to be given to the opposite parties. It is to be noted that as such, appellant has been appearing through their counsel and their authorised representatives and even Shri Mukesh Aggarwal, Director of original opposite party No.1 has remained present in person either through physical mode or though video conferencing."
