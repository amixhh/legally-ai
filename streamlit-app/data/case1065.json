The Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) vide order dated September 29, 1983 allowed Rs. 26,84,235 as admissible revenue expenditure and at the same time directed the Assessing Officer to withdraw the depreciation and development rebate granted on these capitalized items, as they have been treated as revenue expenditure.",

Baroda Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. [1992] 198 ITR 716 (Guj) and in the case of CIT v. Satyadev Chemical Ltd. [1997] 226 ITR 95 (Guj) has been impliedly overruled by this Court in the case of CIT v. Saravana Spinning Mills (P.) Ltd. [2007] 7 SCC 298 : [2007] 293 ITR 201 (SC) . She submitted that each item for which deduction under the head \"current repairs\" was sought is a machine by itself and therefore deduction Under Section 31(i) cannot be allowed. She invited our attention to paragraphs 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 of the judgment in the case of Saravana Spinning Mills (P.) Ltd. (supra) and submitted that if the current repairs relate to independent machines itself instead of repair of a part of that machine, deduction cannot be granted Under Section 31(i) of the Income-tax Act,",
        "9. In Saravana Spinning Mills (P.) Ltd. (supra) this Court has held that in a textile mill there are several Departments/divisions. In each Department/division there are several machines and perform different functions. Therefore, when each of the Department/Division perform different functions, repair/substitution of an old machine will not come within the definition of the word \"current repairs\" and deduction cannot be claimed thereunder."
