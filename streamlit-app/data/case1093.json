        "41. 2019, last opportunity was given to the Respondent and it was indicated that if the Respondent chose not to enter appearance, the matter would be disposed of ex-parte.

Having gone through the matter, we give one more opportunity to the Respondent to enter appearance and make submissions with respect to the merits of the matter. If the Respondent still chooses not to appear, the matter shall definitely be decided ex-parte.?(emphasis supplied)The Applicant – Company remained unrepresented despite service on its authorised representative, on",
        "42. 2019, and on",
        "43. 2019, when the matter was taken up for final hearing, and judgment was reserved.",
        "44. During oral hearing on the Re-call Application, a submission was made by the Counsel for the Applicant – Company that Mr. Sanjeev Narayan was not the ?principal officer? of the Applicant – Company, and hence service could not have been effected upon him. Section 2(35) defines ?principal officer? as follows :?",
        "45. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— (35) \"principal officer\", used with reference to a local authority or a company or any other public body or any association of persons or anybody of individuals, means— (a) the secretary, treasurer, manager or agent of the authority, company, association or body, or (b) any person connected with the management or administration of the local authority, company, association or body upon whom the Assessing Officer has served a notice of his intention of treating him as the principal officer thereof ;?(emphasis supplied)The term ‘agent? would certainly include a power of attorney holder. In State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nehata 2005 (12) SCC 77 this Court held that :?A grant of power of attorney is essentially governed by Chapter X of the Contract Act. By reason of a deed of power of attorney, an agent is formally appointed to act for the principal in one transaction or a series of transactions or to manage the affairs of the principal generally conferring necessary authority upon another person. A deed of power of attorney is executed by the principal in favour of the agent.?(emphasis supplied)Mr. Sanjeev Narayan admittedly being the Power of Attorney holder of the Applicant – M/s. NRA Iron & Steel Pvt. Ltd. for the A.Y. 2009 – 10 was the agent of the Assesse – Company, and hence Notice could be served on him as the agent of the Assessee – Company in this case.",
        "46. The ground taken by Mr. Sanjeev Narayan that even though Notice was served on",
        "47. 2018, he assumed that they were ?some Income Tax Return Documents? lacks credibility. It is difficult to accept that the envelope containing the dasti Notice from this Court was considered to be ?some Income Tax Return documents?. The deponent does not at all disclose as to when the envelope containing the dasti Notice was ever opened. Furthermore, the ground urged that the Chartered Accountant was suffering from an advanced stage of cataract, and hence was constrained from informing his clients is again not worthy of credence. The dasti Notice was admittedly served on him on",
        "48. 2018 at his office, which was much prior to his surgery which he states took place on",
        "49. Mr. Narayan had sufficient time to inform the Applicant – Company of the proceedings, prior to his surgery. Furthermore, Mr. Narayan appeared before the Income Tax Authorities to represent the Applicant – Company and its sister concerns on various dates prior to his surgery i.e. on",
        "50. 2018,",
        "51. 2018,",
        "52. 2018 and",
        "53. Keeping in view the above-mentioned facts and circumstances, this Court is satisfied that the Applicant – Company was duly served through their authorized representative, and were provided sufficient opportunities to appear before this Court, and contest the matter. The Applicant – Company chose to let the matter proceed ex- parte. The grounds for Re-call of the Judgment are devoid of any merit whatsoever."
