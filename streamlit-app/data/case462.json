        "1. J.P. Devadhar, J.The Appeal is admitted on the following questions of law and taken up for hearing by consent of the parties:a) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Honble Tribunal, in law, was justified in upholding the order of the learned CIT (A) in not sustaining the addition made by the Assessing Officer being the difference between the amount of investment advisory fees computed at the maximum rates specified in Regulation 52(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Fund) Regulation, 1996 (SEBI Regulations) and actually charged by the Assesseeb) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Honble Tribunal, in law, was justified in upholding the order of the learned CIT (A) in not sustaining the addition made by the Assessing Officer relating to the recurring and marketing expenses without appreciating the fact that this amount of expenditure the AMC was empowered to charge under SEBI Regulations to the Mutual Fund, but it has charged the same to its own accounts, thereby reducing its taxable income, and hence not be allowable as deduction in view of the provisions of section 37(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961c) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Honble Tribunal, in law, was justified in upholding the order of the learned CIT (A) in not sustaining the addition made by the Assessing Officer being towards 2/3rd share of recurring expenses in excess of the limits specified in Regulation 52(7) of SEBI Regulation which was borne by the Assessee without appreciating the fact that the amount of expenditure, which becomes the liability either of the sponsor or the trustee of the Mutual Fund, is not deductible under section 37(1) of the Income Tax Act in the hands of the Assessee Company\"d) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Honble Tribunal, in law, was justified in upholding the order of the learned CIT (A) in not sustaining the disallowance made by the Assessing Officer of initial issue expenses of the Mutual Fund Scheme incurred by the Assessee which pertain to the business of the Mutual Fund, without appreciating the fact that these are the expenses incurred by the Assessee Company on behalf of Mutual Fund and are pertaining to Schemes which are of Mutual Fund which the Assessee Company was empowered by the SEBI Regulations to charge to the Mutual Fund Scheme",
        "2. The Assessment Year involved herein is A.Y. 2003-",
        "3. The Assessee is a private limited company engaged in the business of Asset Management of Mutual Funds. In the Assessment Year in question, the Assessing Officer on noticing that the Assessee has claimed investment advisory fees, less than the ceiling prescribed under Regulation 52 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 added the differential amount to the income of the Assessee.",
        "4. The CIT (A) as also the ITAT have held that the SEBI Regulation 52 provides for the maximum limit towards the fees that could be charged by an Asset Management Company from the Mutual Funds. Due to the business exigencies if the Assessee an Asset Management Company collects lesser amount of fees than the ceiling prescribed, it is not open to the Assessing Officer to make additions on notional basis merely because the amount of fees actually claimed is less than the maximum ceiling prescribed under the SEBI Regulation. It is not the case of the Revenue that the Assessee has recovered investment advisory fees more than what is said to have been claimed by the Assessee. Therefore, the fact that the SEBI Regulation provides for the maximum limit on the investment advisory fees that could be claimed, it cannot be said that the Asset Management Companies are liable to be assessed at the maximum limit prescribed under the SEBI Regulations, irrespective of the amount actually recovered by the Asset Management Companies."
