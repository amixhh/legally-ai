        "35. However, the said writ petition was permitted to be converted into a transfer petition.",
        "36. Mr. Sodhi, learned counsel appearing for some of the respondents, would contend that having regard to the fact that the Company would not suffer any prejudice in the event the civil suits filed by the firm and/or its partners are permitted to be determined at different courts in the State of Punjab, particularly when the company has an office in Punjab and Haryana and, thus, the balance of convenience lies in allowing the civil proceedings to be tried at their original courts of filing. It was urged that in some of the matters, evidences were being led.",
        "37. Mr. Bhatt, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, urged that the purported agreement being a forged one, the question of the parties being bound thereby does not arise.",
        "38. The parties hereto are governed by the terms of the contract. If, in terms of the provisions of the contract, they by agreement conferred jurisdiction on one of the courts which would have otherwise jurisdiction to deal with the matter, the same should ordinarily be given effect to. In A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. A.P. Agencies, Salem [(1989) 2 SCC 163] , this Court held that when the Court has to decide the question of jurisdiction pursuant to an ouster clause, it is necessary to construe the same properly. In such an event, it was opined that other courts should avoid exercise of jurisdiction. [See also Hanil Era Textiles Ltd. v. Puromatic Filters (P) Ltd. [(2004) 4 SCC 671] Yet again in Rajasthan State Electricity Board v. Universal Petrol Chemicals Ltd. [(2009) 3 SCC 107] , this court held: \"",
        "39. The aforesaid legal proposition settled by this Court in respect of territorial jurisdiction and applicability of Section 20 of the Code to Arbitration Act is clear, unambiguous and explicit. The said position is binding on both the parties who were contesting the present proceeding. Both the parties with their open eyes entered into the aforesaid purchase order and agreements thereon which categorically provide that all disputes arising between the parties out of the agreements would be adjudicated upon and decided through the process of arbitration and that no court other than the court at Jaipur shall have jurisdiction to entertain or try the same. In both the agreements in Clause 30 of General Conditions of the Contract it was specifically mentioned that the contract shall for all purposes be construed according to the laws of India and subject to jurisdiction of only at Jaipur in Rajasthan Courts only and in addition in one of the purchase order the expression used was that the Court at Jaipur only would have jurisdiction to entertain or try the same.\" It was opined : \"",
        "40. The parties have clearly stipulated and agreed that no other court, but only the court at Jaipur will have jurisdiction to try and decide the proceedings arising out of the said agreements, and therefore, it is the Civil Court at Jaipur which would alone have jurisdiction to try and decide such issue and that is the court which is competent to entertain such proceedings. The said court being competent to entertain such proceedings, the said Court at Jaipur alone would have jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of the reference. The arbitration proceedings have to be made at Jaipur Court and in no other court.\"",
        "41. It is not in dispute that two awards have been made by two different arbitrators. Objections to the said awards have been filed by both the parties. One of the questions which, thus, is required to be taken into consideration is as to whether the appointment of respective arbitrators by the parties was valid and, thus, whether the arbitrators had acted within the four corners of the arbitration agreement.",
        "42. It is true that respondent No.6 is not a party to the arbitration agreement but he is claiming interest under the firm who had appointed him as its distributor pursuant to such an authority having been conferred upon the firm by the company. We, therefore, are of the opinion that although stricto sensu respondent No.6 is not a party to the contract, his case also should be transferred."
