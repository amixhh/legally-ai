        "28. It was the contention of Respondent No.5 that the insistence on the part of the appellant that Respondent No.5 must deposit the tax or furnish the bank guarantee was contrary to the terms of the Arbitration Award and thus the costs in respect of such bank guarantee which were to the tune of Rs.",

        "37. Having gone through the matter and considered the rival submissions we affirm the view taken by the High Court. The interest of the appellant was well secured by the Award dated",
        "38. 2011 which was a Consent Award. Respondent No.5 had an interim order in its favour passed by the High Court and it was only because of the insistence on part of appellant that Respondent No.5 was directed to furnish the bank guarantee. It is, therefore, but logical and consequential that the appellant must bear the costs for securing such bank guarantee."
