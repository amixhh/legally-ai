    "Input": [
        "1. This Court passed judgment and order in C.A. Nos.6328-6399 of 2015 – Union of India v. Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India and other civil appeals decided by a common judgment and order dated",
        "2. The Court decided regarding the definition of the AGR and dues to be paid thereunder.",
        "3. The concept of AGR arose in the light of the provisions contained in the policy framed by the Government of India and the provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act. Under section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act, the Central Government has the exclusive privilege of establishing, maintaining, and working telegraphs. Section 4 of the Telegraph Act enables the Central Government to part with the exclusive privilege in favour of any other person by granting a licence on such conditions and considering such terms as it thinks fit. The licence issued under section 4(1) becomes a contract between a licensor and a licensee. This Court considered the provisions of the Telegraph Act in AUSPI (I) matter – (2011) 10 SCC 543 in this very case, thus:",
        "4. A bare perusal of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Telegraph Act shows that the Central Government has the exclusive privilege of establishing, maintaining and working telegraphs. This would mean that only the Central Government, and no other person, has the right to carry on telecommunication activities. x x x",
        "5. The proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Telegraph Act, however, enables the Central Government to part with this exclusive privilege in favour of any other person by granting a licence in his favour on such conditions and in consideration of such payments as it thinks fit. As the Central Government owns the exclusive privilege of carrying on telecommunication activities and as the Central Government alone has the right to part with this privilege in favour of any person by granting a licence in his favour on such conditions and in consideration of such terms as it thinks fit, a licence granted under the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Telegraph Act is in the nature of a contract between the Central Government and the licensee.",
        "6. A Constitution Bench of this Court in State of Punjab v. Devans Modern Breweries Ltd., (2004) 11 SCC 26 , relying on Har Shankar case, (1975) 1 SCC 737 and Panna Lal v. State of Rajasthan, (1975) 2 SCC 633 , has held in para 121 at p. 106 that issuance of liquor licence constitutes a contract between the parties. Thus, once a licence is issued under the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Telegraph Act, the licence becomes a contract between the licensor and the licensee. Consequently, the terms and conditions of the licence including the definition of adjusted gross revenue in the licence agreement are part of a contract between the licensor and the licensee. We have to, however, consider whether the enactment of the TRAI Act in 1997 has in any way affected the exclusive privilege of the Central Government in respect of the telecommunication activities and altered the contractual nature of the licence granted to the licensee under the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Telegraph Act.",
        "7. Section 2(e) of the TRAI Act quoted above defines licensee to mean any person licensed under sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Telegraph Act for providing specified public telecommunication services and Section 2(ea) defines licensor to mean the Central Government or the telegraph authority who grants a licence under Section 4 of the Telegraph Act. Sub-section 2(k) defines telecommunication service very widely so as to include all kinds of telecommunication activities. These provisions under the TRAI Act do not affect the exclusive privilege of the Central Government to carry on telecommunication activities nor do they alter the contractual nature of the licence granted under the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Telegraph Act. (emphasis supplied)",
        "8. During consideration of the matter, concerning the M.A. filed by the Union of India for extension of time to make the payment, it was pointed out that several telecom service providers were under insolvency proceedings under The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (for short the Code). This Court passed an order on",
        "9. 2020, and the same is extracted hereunder: We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties at length with respect to the prayer made by the Central Government and the time frame for making the payment as per the order passed by this Court. During course of hearing, again an attempt was made to wriggle out of our judgment and orders, which were passed by this Court under the guise of reassessment and recalculation. That is not at all permissible. In view of decision, there is no scope of raising any further dispute with respect to any item or to raise fresh dispute. No dispute can be raised with respect to dues and they have to be paid. New round of litigation is prohibited. In the second inning, we have heard the same after remand of the issues to the TDSAT. Thereafter, there is no question of entertaining any kind of dispute with respect to the payment and dues worked out. No dispute shall be entertained. The calculations which have been given and the amount to be recovered at pages 180-181 of M.A.D. No. 9887 of 2020 (application for modification) in C.A. No. 6328-6399 of 2015 are taken to be as final amount and there can be no dispute raised about it. No recalculation and self-assessment can be undertaken. The calculations are as under :- AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM MAJOR TSPs AS PER PRILIMINARY ASSESSMENTS Table TSPs under Insolvency Table Note :",
        "10. Total Demands are inclusive of Principal, Interest, Penalty and Interest on Penalty.",
        "11. Total Demands have been calculated generally up to FY 2016-",
        "12. On these outstanding amounts, Interest/Penalty/Interest on Penalty is calculated up to October,",
        "13. All dues are subject to further revisions due to departmental assessments, CAG audits, Special Audits, Court Cases etc. However, when we consider the dues of Telecom Service Providers under insolvency, we find that there are several companies which have dues to the extent of Rs. 38,",
        "14. 27 crores, which have gone under liquidation. Since the dues are huge, we propose to examine the bonafides of the initiation of the proceedings under the IBC. Let all the documents of the companies viz. Aircel Group of Companies, Reliance Communication/Reliance Telecom Limited, Sistema Shyam Teleservices Ltd. and Videocon Telecommunications Ltd. relating to liquidation and orders passed in proceedings be placed on record within 10 days from today. We have closed the matter with respect to the prayer made for making the payment in installments and the offer made by the Government, the time frame thereto and how to secure the amount. The order is reserved on that aspect. However, we will hear the matter separately with respect to the companies under liquidation and test the bonafides of their action and how to ensure that the amount is recovered. Let all the documents be placed on record within 10 days from today and the matter be listed for hearing about these companies on the above aspect on",
        "15. Written submissions and the reply, if any, be filed on or before",
        "16. This Court wanted to examine the bona fides of the telecom service providers who have resorted to the process of insolvency, hence, invited them to file their response. Before the initiation of insolvency proceedings, most of the telecom service providers who are under the insolvency proceedings had applied to the Department of Telecommunications to grant permission for trading of licence. The Central Government objected on the ground that it would not be possible for it to grant permission. It declined the permission. There were huge arrears concerning the spectrum licence, which were required to be paid, as a pre-condition to such permission. Various sharing arrangements made inter se telecom service providers with respect to the spectrum also came to the fore.",
        "17. The Union of India, Department of Telecommunications stand is that the spectrum cannot be the subject-matter of the IBC proceedings in view of the provisions in sections 14 and",
        "18. The dues under the licence towards the spectrums use cannot be put in the category of operational dues. In contrast, the Department of Commerce holds the opinion that the dues under the licence are operational dues, and the provisions of the IBC are applicable. The Department of Telecommunications also pointed out that as per guideline Nos.10, 11, and 12 of the Guidelines relating to the trading of 2015, it is a pre- condition of trading licence that the seller pays dues of licence arrears. After that, the purchaser has to pay arrears as provided in paras 10, 11, and 12 of the guidelines.",
        "19. The telecom service providers stand is that the proceedings of insolvency under the Code have been triggered bona fide. This Court can examine the limited question in these proceedings whether the proceedings are resorted to as a subterfuge to avoid payment of AGR dues, and it is for the NCLT to decide whether the licence/spectrum can be transferred and be a part of the resolution process initiated under the provisions of the Code. Whether spectrum/licence can be subjected to resolution process as an asset belonging to the telecom service providers, and whether the AGR dues are operational dues and have to be dealt with under the provisions of the IBC by NCLT. With respect to the trading and sharing arrangement to the extent of spectrum traded or shared by different service providers under the sharing arrangement, the liability as per the guidelines, has to be borne by the respective telecom service providers.",
        "20. As per the statutory guidelines issued by the Department of Telecommunications in 2015, spectrum sharing allows the operators to pool their respective spectrum for usage in a specific geographical area. The Central Government framed spectrum sharing guidelines on",
        "21. The details of sharing arrangement between different telecom service providers have been given.",
        "22. The spectrum trading allows parties to transfer their rights and obligations to another party. In the case of spectrum sharing, the right to use spectrum remains with the respective telecom service providers, whereas in the case of spectrum trading, the right to use gets transferred from the buyer to the seller. Under spectrum trading guidelines, details of transactions which have taken place, are given.",
        "23. Another aspect is that how much time is to be provided to the telecom service providers to pay AGR dues. The Union of India on the representation made by the telecom service providers and Indian Banks Association, has decided to provide the facility of making payment in instalments within 20 years.",
        "24. The following three questions arise for consideration: (1) Whether spectrum can be subjected to proceedings under the Code? (2) In the case of sharing, how the payment is to be made by the Telecom Service Provider (for short, TSP)? and (3) In the case of trading, how the liability of the seller and buyer is to be determined? In Re. Whether spectrum can be subjected to proceedings under the Code?",
        "25. Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General of India on behalf of Government of India, argued as under: (i) Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, provides that the Central Government has the exclusive privilege of establishing, maintaining, and working telegraphs. The DoT grants licences which are in the form of contractual arrangements. The TSPs are bound by the terms and conditions contained therein. As per the contractual terms, the licence is strictly contingent upon fulfilment of the terms and conditions, the payment being first and foremost. On failure of payment, the licensor is entitled to take action under the Licence Agreement, including revocation and termination. (ii) The spectrum is a scarce recognised natural resource, and this Court in 2G judgment [C.A.No.423 of 2010] held that the natural resources belong to the people and cannot be subjected to proceedings under the Code. The State acts as a guardian and trustee of the natural resources. (iii) The licensee does not own the spectrum and has merely been granted a right to use, which is based on fulfilment of the conditions of the contract in the form of a Licence Agreement. Thus, the spectrum cannot be subjected to transfer in proceedings under the Code as the licensee is not the owner. Section 18(f), along with its Explanation (a), mandates that only the corporate debtors assets can be taken into control and custody by the resolution professionals, which is in the ownership of the corporate debtor. Explanation to Section 18 provides that assets owned by a third party in possession of the corporate debtor or held under contractual arrangements are not included in the term assets for the purpose of Section",
        "26. It is not an asset for Section",
        "27. The spectrum held under a contractual arrangement is not an asset of the corporate debtor. The spectrum cannot be a subject matter of proceedings under the Code. The resolution professional has no jurisdiction to prepare a resolution plan as per Guidelines for Trading of Access Spectrum by Access Services Providers (for short, the Guidelines of 2015) issued on",
        "28. (iv) Guideline No.10 provides that for trading of right to use the spectrum, both the licensees shall give an undertaking that they are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Guidelines for spectrum trading that is seller and buyer both. In case terms and conditions for spectrum trading are not fulfilled, the Government will have the right to take appropriate action including annulment of trading arrangement. (v) As per Guideline Nos. 11 and 12 of the Guidelines of 2015, the seller has to clear the dues. After the trading date, the Government has the discretion to recover the amount from the seller or buyer, jointly or severally. (vi) The permission was sought to trade the licence; however, the Government of India, DoT, declined it because arrears have to be paid, and other conditions were not fulfilled. After that, insolvency proceedings were initiated, which were not permissible concerning the spectrum given provisions contained in Section 18 of the Code. (vii) National Company Law Tribunal (for short, the NCLT), Mumbai vide order dated",
        "29. 2019, held that licence is an asset of State over which the corporate debtor has no right of ownership. The above argument of the State Government was accepted; however, in view of the provisions contained in Section 14 on moratorium being created, the licence could not be revoked. An appeal was filed before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (for short, the NCLAT) against the order mentioned above, which was dismissed on the ground of limitation. An appeal has been filed in relation to the revocation of licence, which is pending in this Court registered as Diary No.15564 of",
        "30. (viii) The licence under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, was granted on certain terms and conditions. The spectrum did not construe property as defined in Section 3(27) of the Code. (ix) Concerning public trust doctrine, reliance has been placed on Centre for Public Interest Litigation and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. (2012) 3 SCC 1 , in which it was held that natural resources must always be used in the countrys interests, not private interests. The corporate debtor can never be said to be in occupation of either the licence or spectrum as per Section 14(1)(d) of the Code. Any dispute is to be settled under the provisions of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 by the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellant Tribunal. (x) Reliance has been placed on M/s. Embassy Property Development Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Karnataka [C.A.No.9170 of 2019], in which this Court held that the Code would not apply to right to mine as exclusive possession had not been granted to the corporate debtor and grant was limited to right to mine, excavate and recover iron ore and red oxide for a specified period. It was further held that the right not to be dispossessed found in Section 14(1)(d) of the Code would have nothing to do with the rights conferred by a mining lease, especially on a Government land. (xi) In Ram Dass v. Davinder, (2004) 3 SCC 684 , it was held that possession amounts to holding property as an owner, while occupy is to keep possession by being present in it. Spectrum is not capable of being in possession of licensee neither in the eye of law they can be said to be in possession. (xii) As per Regulation 32 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016, the spectrum agreement cannot be held to be essential goods or services under Section 14(2) of the Code. Similarly, it cannot be subjected to proceedings under Section 18 of the Code. In the resolution plan, selling the right to use the spectrum to some other company could not have been made. A corporate debtor cannot create any third party right in any manner whatsoever. Against the order dated",
        "31. 2020 passed by the NCLT approving the resolution plan of UVARC, DoT has filed a petition before the NCLAT relating to Aircel Group. Guidelines are statutory and binding. Aircel Licensee has defaulted in making payment of Deferred Spectrum Auction. (xiii) In the case of RCOM, W.P. (C) No.845 of 2018 was filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India for closure/quashing of the CIRP initiated against it. After that, payment was made to M/s. Ericsson India Pvt. Ltd, who initiated the proceedings under the Code. RCOM has sought NOC to trade Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (for short, RJIL). DoT informed it on",
        "32. 2018 that the Government couldnt give the NOC for trading. This Court decided the proceedings on",
        "33. Thereafter, the Board of Directors of RCOM decided to continue with the proceeding under the Code and, decided to withdraw the appeal from NCLAT. RCL/RTL defaulted in payment of various deferred spectrum auction instalments. (xiv) The matters of AGR being C.A. Nos.6328-6399 of 2015 were sub judice before the commencement of CIRP. A demand was raised to RCL/RTL. AGR dues amount of RCL/RTL is Rs.25,",
        "34. 27 crores. (xv) In the case of Videocon, DoT was not the party. DoT was not invited to the Committee of Creditors meetings, in complete violation of the provisions of the Code. The resolution professional applied before NCLT to restrain DoT from encashing certain bank guarantees submitted by Videocon, in which interim injunction has been granted.",
        "35. Shri Harish Salve, learned senior counsel argued as under: (i) The NCLT should decide the question of whether the spectrum can be sold or not. After that, there is a provision for an appeal to NCLAT, and then this Court can look into the matter. (ii) Under Section 18, the spectrum can be subjected to insolvency proceedings. This Court examined the question of recoverability of AGR dues in preference to the dues of secured creditors on the basis that the use of spectrum would rank in priority higher than that of secured creditors. Leasing of the spectrum is not permissible as per the Guidelines. The RJIL is also not proposing to buy any spectrum from the resolution applicant of RCOM or any other company. Only sharing and trading is permissible subject to the conditions specified in the Guidelines. The assets of RCOM are comprised primarily of the spectrum, real estate, and active assets. Even if this Court permitted the sale of such a spectrum, RJIL is not intending to acquire the same. (iii) RJIL has paid Rs.195 crores on a self-assessment basis and shall pay a further sum demanded by DoT.",
        "36. Shri Shyam Divan and Shri Ravi Kadam, learned senior counsel on behalf of Committee of Creditors of RCOM, Aircel Limited, and Dishnet Wireless Limited, argued: (i) the spectrum and telecom licences are assets of the telecom company. Section 18(f) of the Code mandates that resolution professional would take control and custody of any asset over which the corporate debtor has ownership rights as recorded in the balance sheet of the corporate debtor. Section18(f)(iv) includes intangible assets. The telecom licence and right to use the spectrum form a part of the intangible assets. The right to use is a valuable right. In the financial statement, telecom licence and the right to use the spectrum had been shown as an intangible asset. Without telecom licences and spectrum, there would be no hope of reviving Aircel entities. (ii) Clause 6 of the Licence Agreement deals with the restrictions of transfer of licence by either directly or indirectly without the prior written consent of the licensor. It can be transferred on fulfilment of certain conditions. (iii) Reliance has been placed on Consultation Paper dated",
        "37. Its licence/spectrum is considered an intangible asset, and in the Guidelines for the Reporting System on Accounting Separation Regulations, 2016, the right to use spectrum is again shown as an intangible asset. The Indian Accounting Standards-38 has also been referred to indicate that an asset is a resource controlled by the entity for further economic benefits. The spectrum and licence being assets of the telecom company are not assets owned by a third party under a trust. (iv) The licence and spectrum of Aircel Entities are held in security by the lenders in terms of the TPAs to which the DoT is also a party. In the resolution plans, DoT acted as an operational creditor. The NCLT asked to take the approval of the DoT for the transacting spectrum. Thus, it is for the DoT to give permission. Dot has to approve the implementation of the resolution plan. (v) The Code provides that the resolution plan is to be approved by the Committee of Creditors, and the adjudicating authority of the NCLT in terms of Section 31 of the Code and liquidation is to be made in terms of the priority set out in Section 53 of the Code. Section 5(20) defines operational creditor. Section 5(21) defines operational debt to include dues payable to the Government. Thus, claims of DoT for unpaid dues are operational debts, and DoT is an operational creditor. (vi) Reliance has been placed upon Section 31 of the Code. The resolution plan shall be binding on the corporate debtors, including the Central Government, any State Government to whom a debt in respect of the payment of dues arising under any law for the time being in force. Reliance has also been placed on Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Limited v. Satish Kumar Gupta and Ors., (2019) SCC OnLine SC",
        "38. (vii) The proceedings under the Code cannot be nullified to realise AGR and other dues of DoT.",
        "39. Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel, on behalf of Committee of Creditors of Aircel Limited, Aircel Cellular Limited and Dishnet Wireless Limited argued that: (i) under the Code, UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited has submitted a resolution plan, which has been approved by the NCLT on",
        "40. Aircel Entities are holders of telecom licences. The licences issued by DoT contain the format for the execution of the Tripartite Agreement between the licensor, licensee, and the lenders. He has relied upon the following paragraph: With a view to help and facilitate the financing of the Project to be set up by the LICENSEE pursuant to the LICENCE referred to above, the parties hereto are desirous of recording the terms and conditions to provide transfer/assignment of LICENCE as hereinafter provided in this AGREEMENT to protect and secure the Lenders interest arising out of grant of financial assistance to the LICENSEE. (ii) Aircel Entities have offered lenders spectrum as a security against the loans advanced by the lenders to Aircel Entities. Thus, the DoT claim over the spectrum will be subservient to the claims of the lenders as per the Code, and DoT has to be treated as an operational creditor. (iii) The Banks are in the business of lending money for the betterment of the national economy, in the same manner, the Government is in the business of spectrum. As per Clause",
        "41. 3 of the Licence Agreement, licence can be transferred subject to fulfilment of the conditions agreed between the licensor, licensee, and the lenders. (iv) The right to use spectrum is an asset of the corporate debtor. Paras",
        "42. 4 and",
        "43. 5 of the Insolvency Law Committee Report have been referred to. Revocation of Licences, permission-based on past dues, is prohibited under Section 14 after the moratorium is created. Current dues have to be paid during the moratorium period. He has referred to Sections 3(27) and 14(1). (v) The provisions of the Code have to prevail. The Government has entered into a pure business transaction by granting a licence and taking fees against the grant. The spectrum is a raw material for telecom companies. If the spectrums licence is terminated, the resolution professional will find it difficult to run the company as a going concern. DoT is an operational creditor. AGR dues are contractual dues and cannot have precedence over the dues of secured creditors. He has referred to Section 53 to contend that the operational creditor is protected in a manner provided in the Code. Section 238 of the Code contains a non-obstante clause to the effect that anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force, the Code shall prevail. As such, the Code overrides the provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act,",
        "44. In the case of RCOM, the resolution plan is pending consideration of the adjudicating authority under Section 31 of the Code.",
        "45. Whether spectrum can be subjected to proceedings under the Code is a significant question and is required to be gone into. It is a natural resource, and under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, the Government has the sovereign right. Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 is extracted hereunder:",
        "46. Exclusive privilege in respect of telegraphs, and power to grant licences.— (1) Within India, the Central Government shall have the exclusive privilege of establishing, maintaining and working telegraphs: Provided that the Central Government may grant a license, on such conditions and in consideration of such payments as it thinks fit, to any person to establish, maintain, or work a telegraph within any part of India: Provided further that the Central Government may, by rules made under this Act and published in the Official Gazette, permit, subject to such restrictions and conditions as it thinks fit, the establishment, maintenance and working— (a) of wireless telegraphs on ships within Indian territorial waters and on aircrafts within or above India, or Indian territorial waters, and (b) of telegraphs other than wireless telegraphs within any part of India. Explanation.—The payments made for the grant of a licence under this sub-section shall include such sum attributable to the Universal Service Obligation as may be determined by the Central Government after considering the recommendation made in this behalf by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India established under sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 (24 of 1997). (2) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, delegate to the telegraph authority all or any of its powers under the first proviso to sub-section (1). The exercise by the telegraph authority of any power so delegated shall be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Central Government may, by the notification, think fit to impose. (3) Any person who is granted a license under the first proviso to sub-section (1) to establish, maintain or work a telegraph within any part of India, shall identify any person to whom it provides its services by— (a) authentication under the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (18 of 2016); or (b) offline verification under the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (18 of 2016); or (c) use of passport issued under Section 4 of the Passports Act, 1967 (15 of 1967); or (d) use of any other officially valid document or modes of identification as may be notified by the Central Government in this behalf. (4) If any person who is granted a license under the first proviso to sub-section (1) to establish, maintain or work a telegraph within any part of India is using authentication under clause (a) of sub-section (3) to identify any person to whom it provides its services, it shall make the other modes of identification under clauses (b) to (d) of sub-section (3) also available to such person. (5) The use of modes of identification under sub-section (3) shall be a voluntary choice of the person who is sought to be identified and no person shall be denied any service for not having an Aadhaar number. (6) If, for identification of a person, authentication under clause (a) of sub-section (3) is used, neither his core biometric information nor the Aadhaar number of the person shall be stored. (7) Nothing contained in sub-sections (3), (4) and (5) shall prevent the Central Government from specifying further safeguards and conditions for compliance by any person who is granted a license under the first proviso to sub-section (1) in respect of identification of person to whom it provides its services. Explanation.—The expressions Aadhaar number and core biometric information shall have the same meanings as are respectively assigned to them in clauses (a) and (j) of Section 2 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (18 of 2016).",
        "47. Section 3(10) defines creditor. The term debt is defined in Section 3(11). The expression property is defined in Section 3(27). Operational creditor is defined in Section 5(20) in Part II under the head Insolvency Resolution and Liquidation for Corporate Persons. Section 5(21) defines operational debt.",
        "48. A question has been raised concerning ownership. Whether TSPs can be said to be the owner based on the right to use the spectrum under licence granted to them? Whether a licence is a contractual arrangement? Whether ownership belongs to the Government of India? Whether spectrum being under contract can be subjected to proceedings under Section 18 of the Code? The question also arises whether the spectrum can be said to be in possession, which arises from ownership. What is the distinction between possession and occupation? Whether possession correlates with the ownership right? A question also arises concerning the difference between trading and insolvency proceedings. Whether a licence can be transferred under the insolvency proceedings, particularly when the trading is subjected to clearance of dues by seller or buyer, as the case may be, as provided in Guideline Nos.10 and 11; whereas in insolvency proceedings dues are wiped off. Guideline No.12 is also assumed to be of significance in case spectrum is subjected to insolvency proceedings, which must be considered.",
        "49. It is also required to be examined that when Government has declined the permission to trade and has not issued NOC for trading on the ground of non-fulfilment of the conditions as stipulated in the Licence Agreement, the spectrum can be subjected to resolution proceedings which will have the effect of wiping off the dues of the Government, which are more than Rs.40,000 crores. Whereas the dues of the Banks are much less. Whether obtaining the DoTs permission and its approval to the resolution plan would be a substitute for Trading Guideline Nos.10, 11, and 12 ?",
        "50. A question also arises of bona fide nature of the proceedings under the Code. In the backdrop facts of the cases, question also arises whether spectrum licence subjected to proceedings under the Code, and it overrides the provisions contained in the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act,",
        "51. In view of the fact that the licence contained an agreement between the licensor, licensee, and the lenders, whether on the basis of that, spectrum can be treated as a security interest and what is the mode of its enforcement. Whether the Banks can enforce it in the proceedings under the Code or by the procedure as per the law of enforcement of security interest under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act) or under any other law.",
        "52. A question of seminal significance also arises whether the spectrum is a natural resource, the Government is holding the same as cestui que trust. In view of the nature of the resource, it can be subjected to insolvency/liquidation proceedings. Earlier licence was obtained on the payment of fees in advance that was not beneficial to the TSPs, as such a new revenue sharing regime was devised in 1999, and the Central Government has an exclusive right under section 4 of the Telegraph Act, 1885 in use of spectrum, it can part with on certain statutory guidelines, its use is not permissible without the payment of requisite fee. Whether dues under the licence can be said to be operational dues? It is also to be examined whether deferred/default payment instalment/s of spectrum acquisition cost can be termed to be operational dues besides AGR dues. Whether as per the revenue sharing regime and the provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, the dues can be said to be operational dues? Whether natural resource would be available to use without payment of requisite dues, whether such dues can be wiped off by resorting to the proceedings under the Code and comparative dues of Government, and secured creditors and bona fides of proceedings are also the questions to be considered.",
