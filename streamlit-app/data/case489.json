The submission on behalf of the appellant was that in view of the ocular evidence available with regard to the assault, the High Court erred in acquitting the respondent on the reasoning that though the assault was with the sharp end of the plough which had nails, there was no corresponding injury as the nature of injury found could only be by blunt hard substance. The acquittal, based on the mere opinion of the Doctor PW-6, on the aforesaid ground was unjustified. PW-4 and PW-5 have not been doubted as eye-witnesses or that the latter was injured in the same incident.",
