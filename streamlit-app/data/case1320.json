        "26. 2015 by M/s Crown Consultants, stating that the structure was safe for the next five years, subject to annual civil and structural maintenance work. Over five years have already elapsed since the date of issuance of the Certificate.",
        "27. On",

        "46. On",
        "47. 2020, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court passed the impugned order granting liberty to the Respondent No.1 to commence the work of removal of adjoining wall with the assistance of M/s Shetgiri and Associates, Architects, at his own risk and costs. The said work was however to be carried out in the presence of the officials of Corporation.",
        "48. In our considered view, the High Court has committed a serious error in directing removal of a wall with the assistance of M/s. Shetgiri and Associates, when there were conflicting reports including an earlier report of the Technical Advisory Committee on the basis of the opinions of other Architects, declaring the building to be of the C-1 category.",
        "49. Even the Report of Shetgiri and Associates, relied upon by the Respondent No. 1, provided: -",
        "50. Brief Description of Repairs to be done: (c) External Plaster External Plaster & Structural repairs: External Plaster to be replaced with new plaster. (d) Structural Repairs Structural Repairs: Damaged Structural members like load bearing walls and its plaster, brick pillars, beams and slabs, where ever exists, should be strengthened and its repairs should be carried out immediately. The said structural repairs should be carried out as per the direction and under the supervision of registered structural engineer.",
        "51. Conclusions of Consultants- The structure has suffered damages to the external walls & RCC elements at various locations. Leakages/capillary action on external wall is due to sub soil water pressure. The said external walls should be repaired immediately with PCC bedding and dampproof course under it so as to protect it from sub soil action. During the course of repairs, propping and barricading is to be provided. Damaged Structural members like load bearing walls and its plaster, brick pillars, beams and slabs, where ever exists, should be strengthened and its repairs should be carried out immediately. The said structural repairs should be carried out as per the direction and under the supervision of registered structural engineer. Many of the observations mentioned above needs immediate attention. Any further delay even if marginal to initiate the major restoration and repair works could lead to a part or complete failure and leading to mishaps, even without warning signals. This could be serious & fatal to both the occupants of the building structure as well as the passerbyes (sic passers by) in close proximity to the structure.",
        "52. It is well settled that the High Court exercising its extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, does not adjudicate hotly disputed questions of facts. It is not for the High Court to make a comparative assessment of conflicting technical reports and decide which one is acceptable.",
        "53. Moreover, the High Court has overlooked the Notes and Limitations mentioned in the report of Shetgiri and Associates, set out hereinbelow: 1) The report is based on visual inspection done as on date, of an accessible area and data provided by client and ND tests results. This report serves a basis of preliminary health heck-up of structure and should not be treated as stability certificate of the building. 2) …….. 3) Inspection of Substructure was not possible and hence condition of structure below plinth cannot be commented on. 4) The observations made in Structural Audit Report are made during the time of Audit. We shall not be held responsible for any changes in Structural condition and/or damages to the structure and/or overloading, at any point of time in case observed. 5) It is requested that the concerned authority must carry out regular maintenance of the structures, sewer lines & premises to avoid any further severe damage to the structure at a later stage. 6) …….. 7) It is extremely important to add here that the structure is almost more than 45 years old and has majorly outlived its economic life. In olden days, especially in 1900s, the Indian Standard codes were basic in nature as compared with what is adopted in the present time. Even if the decision of restoration is adopted, uplifting the structure to an extent that it would be at part with modern structures in terms of the strength, design & safety standards and also the I.S codal provisions especially seismic and wind analysis would be practically ruled-out and possible only if entire structural upliftment is carried out within each and every corner of the structure, which is extremely difficult in case of repair works considering the massive repairs cost involved. Moreover, the foundations of the structure cannot be restored. 8) …….. 9) The report is only limited to the captioned suit building and no other Flat/s, building, structure or Plot of land, premises, room, unit, site, area, division, sub- division or any other surrounding area of the plot or structure has been given any weightage or has been covered in the report. 10) The documents presented before us, if any, are considered while furnishing the said report as mentioned. However, the supporting underlying documents, which are not mentioned in our report and unknown to us, could not be examined or analyzed. As such, our report is based only on the documents if any perused by us and not on any underlying supporting documents if any, not produced before us.",
        "54. The High Court grossly erred in law as well as facts in passing the impugned judgment and order overlooking the fact that the report of Shetgiri and Associates was not a certificate of stability as stated in the report itself in Note 1, extracted above.",
        "55. It is not understood how the High Court could have been satisfied that the stability of the building could be restored by repair in the manner directed. The High Court patently erred in passing the impugned order. The impugned order cannot be sustained.",
        "56. It is recorded that the appellant being the land lord has given a proposal to the Respondent No.1, similar to the proposal offered to the other tenants."
