        "93. 1991 issued by the Bureau of Public Enterprises, Government of Rajasthan, which is the guidelines for absorption of surplus employees of State Public Enterprises. We had heard this appeal earlier and reserved the judgment. At the time of preparation of judgment we found ambiguity in the record of the appeal pertaining to correct wordings of clause 11(b) of Circular dated",
        "94. By our orders dated",
        "95. 2020 we directed both the parties to bring on record correct clause 11(b) of Circular dated",
        "96. In pursuance of our order dated",
        "97. 2020 both the parties have filed their affidavits. In the affidavit filed in application I.A.No.76182 of 2020 filed by the respondent, the copy of Circular dated",
        "98. 1991 has been brought on record. At the time of hearing on",
        "99. 2020, learned counsel for the petitioner has also not disputed the correctness of the copy of the Circular dated",
        "100. 1991 as brought on the record by respondent. Clause 11 of the Circular dated",
        "101. 1991 which is relevant for the present case brought on record by I.A.No.76182 of 2020 is to the following effect:",
        "102. In case the surplus employees covered under CPF Scheme, on absorption:- (a) In an enterprise having CPF Scheme, the balance in CPF account of the surplus employees shall be transferred to the absorbing enterprise. On absorption the surplus employees would be governed by CPF Scheme and rules of the absorbing enterprise. (b) In an enterprise having pension scheme, the balance in CPF Account of surplus employees would be transferred to absorbing enterprise for credit to the GPF Account of the employees and the Pension Fund in proportion of employees own subscription and organisations contribution respectively. The eligible period of service rendered in relieving enterprise would be considered as qualifying service under pension scheme of absorbing enterprise.",
        "103. The petitioner also filed affidavit on",
        "104. 2020 and has not disputed the correctness of clause 11 as brought on record by the respondent.",
        "105. Both CPF and Pension Schemes are beneficial Schemes for the employees which are of different nature. In a Contributory Provident Fund Scheme Employer makes matching contributions to the Employees contribution and both are kept in separate account and on retirement of employees both are released to the employee along with the interest. The Pension is a periodic payment to the employee after the retirement from the service by the Employer. Payment of Pension is made under scheme floated by Employer. Pension Scheme contemplates a fund out of which the pension is payable to an employee. The payment of pension is dependent on various considerations and conditions. This Court in Pepsu Road Transport Corporation, Patiala versus Mangal Singh and others, (2011) 11 SCC 702 , while considering Pension Scheme and contributory Provident Fund Scheme under Pepsu Road Transport Corporation Employees Pension/Gratuity and General Provident Fund Regulations, 1992 made following observations in paragraph 34:-",
        "106. Pension is a retirement benefit partaking of the character of regular payment to a person in consideration of the past services rendered by him. We hasten to add that although pension is not a bounty but is claimable as a matter of right, yet the right is not absolute or unconditional. The person claiming pension must establish his entitlement to such pension in law. The entitlement might be dependent upon various considerations or conditions. In a given case, (sic whether) the retired employee is entitled to pension or not depends on the provisions and interpretation of the rules and regulations. The contributory provident fund appears to be a simple mechanism where an employee is paid the total amount which he has contributed along with the equal contribution made by the employer ordinarily at the time of retirement of an employee. In short, we quote what was repeatedly said by this Court that pension is payable periodically as long as the pensioner is alive whereas CPF is paid only once on retirement. Therefore, conceptually, pension and CPF are separate and distinct.",
        "107. Now reverting to the facts of the present case, we need to first consider as to what were the conditions which were to be fulfilled by the respondent for receiving the pension. As noted above, paragraph 11(b) of guidelines dated",
        "108. 1991 was applicable in the present case with which both the parties are in agreement. It is the case of both the parties that it is clause 11(b) which is applicable in the case of the respondent.",
        "109. Clause 11 begin with the words in case surplus employees were covered under CPF scheme on absorption; - in an Enterprise having Pension Scheme, (i) the balance in CPF account of surplus employee will be transferred to absorbing Enterprise for credit of CPF account of the employee, and (ii) the pension fund in proportion of employees own subscription and organizations contribution respectively; (iii) the eligible period of service rendered in relieving Enterprise would be considered as qualifying service under Pension Scheme of absorbing Enterprise.",
        "110. The circular dated",
        "111. 1991 provided for absorption from one State Public Enterprise to another Public Enterprise. All Public Enterprises were not governed by common CPF and Pension Scheme, for example, Rajasthan Agro Industries Corporation Limited did not have a pension scheme for its employees whereas Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation ltd. has Pension Scheme. When an employee who is governed by CPF Scheme in his erstwhile employment opts for CPF Scheme in absorbing Enterprise, the balance amount in CPF account is transferred and the employees continue in CPF Scheme. There can be two categories of surplus employees, one category may have in its erstwhile Employment Pension Scheme and another category may have only CPF Scheme. In a case where in erstwhile employment employee is governed by Pension Scheme and he opts for Pension Scheme in the absorbing Enterprise, there is no difficulty in implementing of Pension Scheme since balance in CPF account as well as Pension Fund shall be transferred in corresponding accounts in absorbing Enterprise.",
        "112. In this context, we refer to Clause 12 of Circular dated",
        "113. 1991 which is to the following effect: (12)In case the surplus employees were covered by pension scheme, on absorption:- (a)In an enterprise having pension scheme the relieving enterprise would transfer the balance of GPF Account of the employee and his share in the Pension Fund of the relieving organisation to the absorbing organisation for credit to GPF Account and Pension Fund respectively. (b)In an enterprise having CPF Scheme, the balance of GPF Account and share in Pension Fund would be transferred to the absorbing enterprise for credit to the CPF Account. On absorption, the surplus employees would be governed by CPF Scheme and rules of the absorbing enterprise.",
        "114. The respondent in his earlier employment was covered by the CPF Scheme and both employees contribution as well as employers contribution were deposited in the Provident Fund. Alongwith affidavit filed by the respondent in this appeal Certificate of Accounts Transfer, issued by the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, Jaipur has been brought on record. The total deposit of respondent No.1 with the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, Jaipur was (a) contribution of employee Rs.92,504/-; (b) contribution of employer Rs.1,01282/-. Both the above amounts were transferred to the Rajasthan Road State Transport Corporation after the respondent was absorbed in the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation.",
        "115. The contention which has been pressed by the learned counsel for the appellant before us is that there was no transfer of capital amount of the erstwhile employer of respondent. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied and refer to the letter dated",
        "116. 1998 issued by the Rajasthan State Agro Industries Corporation Limited. This has been brought on record as Annexure-P/",
        "117. A perusal of Annexure-P/1 indicates that Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation by letter dated",
        "118. 1998 requested the Rajasthan State Agro Industries Corporation Limited for transferring capital value amount in regard to the respondent. The erstwhile employer of the respondent informed the appellant that capital value amount in regard to the absorbed employees is not due to the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation. The appellant was informed that contribution of Provident Fund amount is deposited in the account of Commissioner, Provident Fund, Government of India which can be got transferred. The question to be answered is as to whether apart from transfer of employees contribution and employers contribution deposited in the account of Commissioner, Provident Fund, there is any other amount which required to be transferred to the appellant for the purpose of making the respondent eligible for the benefit of pension. Regulation 43 of the Regulations, 1989 is the provision of transfer of Pension Fund by Corporation. The Regulation makes it clear that except those employees who have opted for continuing to CPF, employers share shall be transferred to the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation Pension Fund and the employees share with interest shall be transferred to Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation GPF Fund. For the employees who were entitled to grant of pension there is mention of only two Funds that is Pension Fund and GPF Fund. The employers share was to be transferred to Pension Fund and employees share shall be transferred to GPF Fund. Clause 11 sub- cause (b) of Circular dated",
        "119. 1991 also refers to only two accounts i.e. GPF Account and Pension Fund. As per clause 11(b) in an Enterprise having pension scheme, the balance in CPF Account of surplus employees would be transferred to absorbing Enterprise for credit to the GPF Account of the employees and the Pension Fund in proportion of employees own subscription and organisations contribution respectively. Thus, employees contribution shall go to the GPF Account and employers proportion should be credited to the Pension Fund. Clause 11(b) makes it clear that when the respondent was absorbed in Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation, the balance in CPF Account of the surplus employees would be transferred in GPF Account and the Pension Fund respectively. The certificate issued by the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner which has been filed at Annexure R-8 makes it clear that contribution of employee Rs.",
        "120. 504/- and contribution of employer Rs.101282/- have been transferred to the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation which was the amount credited with Regional Provident Fund Commissioner. The entire amount having been transferred to the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation it was the obligation of the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation to credit the aforesaid amount in respect of Pension Fund and GPF Fund. Neither Regulations, 1989 nor Circular dated",
        "121. 1991 refers to any capital amount. There was no obligation of erstwhile employer of the respondent to transfer any capital amount. Neither any such capital amount was contemplated by 1989 Regulations or by Scheme of absorption dated",
        "122. The Circular dated",
        "123. 1991 is in conformity with the Regulations, 1989 and a reading of Regulation 43 of Regulations 1989 as well as Circular dated",
        "124. 1991 makes it abundantly clear that for benefit of Pension Scheme what was required to be transferred by the erstwhile employer was the employees contribution which was to get transferred into the GPF Account and the employers contribution to be credited in the Pension Fund. Nothing more was required to be done by the respondent or erstwhile employer for fulfilling any condition or statutory requirement with regard to the respondents claim of pension. After transfer of the amount aforesaid, the respondent having given option regarding opting the pension scheme, it was statutory obligation of the appellant to credit both the aforesaid amounts and thereafter continues to deposit 10% in the Pension Fund and after retirement calculates the pension accordingly.",
        "125. The notification dated",
        "126. 1997 specially Clause 2(vi) on which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the appellant also does not refer to any sum as a capital amount which needs to be transferred to the appellant for making employee eligible for Pension. The circular dated",
        "127. 1999 filed by the appellant as Annexure-P/2 does refer to capital amount but it relies on notification dated",
        "128. 1997 specifically on Clause 2(vi). Clause 2(vi) of notification dated",
        "129. 1997 does not refer to any capital amount. Thus, the statement in Circular dated",
        "130. 1999 that only upon receipt of capital amount from Rajasthan State Agro Industries Corporation Limited employees were entitled to get benefit of Corporation Pension is unfounded and without any basis. Clause 2(vi) contemplates that those employees who give their option under Employee Pension Scheme, 1989 their deducted Provident Fund Contribution amount of earlier service on receiving back from P.F. Commissioner Office by their employer will be forwarded to Corporation. We have already noticed that both employees contribution and employers contribution which were deposited with Provident Fund Commissioner Office was transferred to Corporation. Thus, what was contemplated by Clause 2(vi) of notification dated",
        "131. 1997 was complied with.",
        "132. We are satisfied that there was no justifiable ground for the appellant for not sanctioning the claim of pension of the respondent after his retirement.",
        "133. Learned counsel for the appellant has emphasized that the respondent continued to receive pension under the CPF Scheme which fact has not been denied by the respondent. The respondents case was that the said amount was accepted by the respondent since he had no option his pension having not been sanctioned by the appellant. We are of view that it was open for the Corporation- appellant while sanctioning the pension to the respondent to deduct the amount of pension received by him under CPF Scheme and the pension could have been accordingly fixed by reducing the pension amount already received by the respondent which respondent was getting under CPF Scheme but that could not have been a reason for denying pension to the respondent. The payment of gratuity to the respondent was also made of Rs. 10 lakh which was paid in the account of the respondent.",
        "134. Learned Single Judge allowing the writ petition filed by the respondent for grant of pension has put a condition that said entitlement is subject to refund of the amount received by him under the CPF Scheme. Learned Single Judge has also rightly directed that neither the appellant nor the respondent shall be entitled for any interest meaning thereby that whatever amount was received by the respondent he was to refund it without any interest accrued on it and whatsoever amount was to be received by the respondent under his entitlement to pension he was not to receive any interest. It is useful to refer to direction of the learned Single Judge contained in paragraph 5 which is to the following effect:",
        "135. In the circumstances, the writ petition is allowed. It is directed that the petitioner shall be treated to be entitled to get pension. However, the same would be subject to his returning/ refunding the amount received by him under the CPF Scheme. In view of the aforesaid direction, neither the petitioner nor the respondents would be entitled to any interest. The exercise may be conducted by the respondents within fifteen days of the amount of CPF is refunded/returned to them.",
        "136. Counsel for the respondent has placed reliance on the judgment of Rajasthan High Court in the writ petition of Mahaveer Prasad Jain. The Division Bench judgment of Rajasthan High Court in D.B. Special Appeal(writ) No.1326 of 2007 decided on",
        "137. 2007 in Jaipur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. through its Chairman and Anr. versus Mahaveer Prasad Jain,reported in 2008 (2) WLN 337,need to be noticed in some detail.",
        "138. In the above case decided by the Division Bench the surplus employee was an employee of Rajasthan State Agro Industries Corporation Limited who was absorbed in Jaipur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam. The case of pension of the employee was allowed by the learned Single Judge against which Special Appeal was filed against the judgment of Learned Single Judge. The appellant accepted that respondent would be governed by the pension scheme and his case is covered by clause 11(b) of Circular dated",
        "139. The Division Bench has held that employee being not covered by Pension Scheme in his earlier employment, his case is governed by clause 11 of Circular dated",
        "140. In paragraph 6 Rajasthan High court made the following observation:",
        "141. We now advert to the second contention. The counsel for the appellant informed us that the Rajasthan State Electricity Board (as it then was) had both the Central Provident Fund Scheme as well as Pension Scheme for its employees. According to the counsel the employees of the Board were given option to either opt for CPF Scheme or Pension Scheme. On the absorption of the original petitioner (respondent No. 1 herein), his CPF Account was closed and instead GPF Account was opened by the Board on",
        "142. Moreover he was asked to deposit employees share of CPF amount which he did. A perusal of the paragraph 13 of the guidelines would show that it is in two parts. Clause (a) thereof applies where the employee was covered under CPF Scheme and absorbing enterprise also has CPF Scheme. Clause (a) provides that the balance in the CPF Account of surplus employee shall be transferred to the absorbing enterprise and on absorption the surplus employee would be governed by the CPF Scheme and the rules of absorbing enterprise while Clause (b) of Para 11 provides that where the absorbing enterprise is having CPF Scheme, the balance in the CPF account of the surplus employees shall be transferred to the absorbing enterprise for credit to the CPF Account of the employees and the Pension Fund in proportion of employees and the pension fund in proportion of the employees subscription and organisations contribution respectively. It further provides that the eligible period of service rendered in relieving enterprise would be considered as qualifying service under pension scheme of absorbing enterprise. In view of the admitted fact that the CPF account of the present respondent was closed after he was absorbed in the RSEB and that he was called upon to deposit employees share of CPF amount which he did, it is apparent that the present appellants accepted that the respondent would be governed by the pension scheme and that his case is covered by 11(b). In this view of the matter, the rejection of the petitioners claim for pension was not legally proper. Merely because the respondent No. 1 had withdrawn the entire CPF amount prior to his absorption would not make any difference because the CPF account was closed by the Board on the employees absorption.",
        "143. In the above case also the balance of C.P.F. amount was deposited in absorbing organization even though in the said case the employee has withdrawn the entire C.P.F. amount prior to his absorption in the subsequent employment. In the present case the respondent has not withdrawn any amount and both the employees and employer contributions were transferred to the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation by Regional Provident Fund Commissioner. Against the judgment of the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court dated",
        "144. 2007, Special Leave Petition (C)No.10904 of 2008 was also filed by Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. which was dismissed by this Court on",
        "145. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the considered opinion that respondent had made out a case for grant of pension by the appellant and both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench did not commit any error in allowing the claim of the respondent for pension.",
        "146. The direction of learned Single Judge in paragraph 5 as stated above amply protected the interest of the appellant.",
        "147. We may also notice that the respondent, who attainted the age of superannuation on",
        "148. 2012, immediately filed the writ petition in the year 2012 itself being Writ Petition No.8847 of 2012 which writ petition was entertained and direction was issued by the learned Single Judge. No delay was caused by the respondent in approaching the High Court for relief of Pension. Before filing the writ petition the respondent has also sent representation in the year 2010 raising his claim for Pension which ought to have alerted the appellant to take appropriate steps.",
        "149. There being an interim order passed by this Court on",
        "150. 2018 in this appeal, the impugned judgment of the High Court could not be given effect by the appellant. Learned Single Judge while allowing the writ petition of the respondent although directed the appellant to return the benefit received by him under the CPF Scheme but had not fixed any time for deposit."
